hot summer day, Turtle found a tent in the sand. Cool! he said. Now I can escape from the hot sun, and he crawled inside. Hey, Mouse! Come and see the tent I found, said Turtle. It is a great place to escape from the hot sun! Thank you, said Mouse, and he crawled into the tent. Hey, Frog! called Turtle and Mouse. Come and see our tent. It is nice and shady in here. Thanks, said Frog as he crawled inside. Hey, Rabbit! they called. Come into our tent and cool off! Thank you, said Rabbit, crawling inside. Hello, Elephant! said Turtle, Mouse, Frog, and Rabbit. We would ask you to join us inside our tent, but there is no more room. We are very sorry. I am the one who is sorry, said Elephant. You see, this is not a tent. It is my hat. Oh, said Turtle. We will look for shade somewhere else. That's OK, friends, said Elephant. We can share it!"

Regina Wilson: Eight years. Reporter: How did you get started? Wilson: First, I had to take a lot of tests. Then, I went to\xa0fire fighter school for 13 weeks. I learned how to put out\xa0fires and how to use equipment, such as the ax and the fire hose. I also had to work out every day! Reporter: How do you stay safe on the job? Wilson: I wear special clothing called bunker gear. It helps keep me protected (safe) from\xa0fire. I also carry an oxygen tank and a mask. They help me to breathe in a smoke-filled building. Reporter: Are there any new tools that\xa0fire fighters use? Wilson: We have a special camera that can see in the dark. It can detect (find) heat. That way, we can tell where a fire is located. Reporter: Do you save pets? Wilson: I recently helped save some kittens. They were hiding under the beds. Pets usually hide during a\xa0fire because they are scared. Reporter: Do you ever get afraid? Wilson: There is no time to be afraid. I think about what I have to do to put out the\xa0fire safely. Reporter: What do you like best about being a fire fighter? Wilson: Helping people!"

                                                                                                                                               Bill went in to see Mr. Majors. Bill stood tall and said, I want to join the Pony Express. Mr. Majors laughed, A big wind could blow you away! he said. You are too young. Gee whiz! said Bill. I'm sixteen. Don't try to fool me! said Mr. Majors. If you are sixteen, then I'm a lizard. I guess I'm closer to fifteen, said Bill. Can you ride? Follow trails? Swim? Shoot? asked Mr. Majors. Yes, sir, said Bill. I roped cattle when I was nine, and I can ride like the wind. It will be no picnic, said Mr. Majors. You must ride seventy or more miles each day. There may be trouble, too. I'm not afraid, Bill said. I like your spunk, son, said Mr. Majors, but you must promise not to lie, not to swear, and not to ght. And you must deliver the mail on time, no matter what. I promise, said Bill. Mr. Majors showed Bill a map. There's St. Joseph, and there's Sacramento, California. Eighty riders and four hundred ponies carry the mail between these cities, said Mr. Majors. That's a long way! said Bill. Yup, said Mr. Majors. It's about two thousand miles. The riders travel all day and night to carry the mail in ten days. They are twice as fast as stagecoaches. Mr. Majors marked Red Buttes [BEWTZ]. That is your home station, he said. Your job is to take the mail from Red Buttes to Three Crossings. More than seventy-five miles on one pony? asked Bill. Of course not! said Mr. Majors. Along the way there are stations with food, shelter, and fresh ponies. After two days' rest, you ride back with more letters. Bill put on his red flannel shirt, a red neckerchief, blue trousers, riding boots, and a ten-dollar hat to keep off the rain. A shiny horn hung from his shoulder. He was a real Pony Express rider now! "

When a snowman melts, it leaves us a gift that lasts all year. To find out what this gift is, let's take a closer look at what happens to the snowman. It has to be warm outside for a snowman to melt. As the sun shines, it makes heat. We can't see heat, but we know it's there because we feel the warmth on our hands and faces. The snowman gets smaller and smaller as it melts, until we can't see it at all. Where did it go? As the snowman melts, it turns into water. If you look carefully at snow, you'll see that it's actually small pieces of ice (called crystals) that are stuck together. When they get warm, the crystals change from ice into water. But where does the water from the snowman go? The ground acts like a sponge and soaks up the water. As the water seeps into the ground, it finds lots of things that are thirsty. The water might find grass roots, flower bulbs, or tree roots. So that's the snowman's year-round gift-it's water! Without water, we wouldn't have colorful flowers to look at in the spring. Without water, we wouldn't have soft, green grass to run barefoot on in the summer. Without water, we wouldn't have strong, tall trees to climb in the fall. Water helps all of these things grow. The snowman's gift lasts all year. "

Robins have dark heads and red chests. A good place to see robins is in your own backyard. Robins don't seem to mind being around people. You may also see robins on lawns or in parks. They are looking for worms and bugs to eat. Early in spring, robins build their nests. They build them in trees. This way the nests will be hidden, so the birds will be safe. The nests are made from grass, sticks, and mud. The mud glues everything together. The mother robin lays one egg a day for three or four days. She sits on them to keep them warm. The eggs are blue. After the babies hatch, both the mother and father feed the babies. The young birds have spots on their chests. Do any robins live near you? Look around. You may be surprised!"

                    Look up in the sky. Do you see any clouds? What do they look like? Some clouds are fluffy and white, like cotton balls. Others are dark, almost black, and make you grab an umbrella. At sunrise and sunset, clouds can look red, purple, or yellow-as if they were colored with crayons. But what are clouds anyway? You can't reach out and touch the clouds, but you can make your own in a bottle. You need an adult helper a huge, empty glass jar metal strainer Do this hot water ice cubes Have your helper fill the jar with hot water, leave it there for two minutes, then pour out most of the water, leaving just an inch or two at the bottom of the jar. 2. It's your turn now. Put the strainer over the mouth of the jar. Fill the strainer with ice cubes. Watch the jar. What happened? A cloud formed in the jar! Some of the hot water at the bottom of the jar turned into hot water vapor. The water vapor rose and bumped into the cold air coming off the ice cubes. When the water vapor condensed, it formed a cloud. Hot air rises and carries with it lots of water vapor. The higher the air rises, the more it cools down. Soon the cold air can't hold all the water vapor so it starts turning into tiny water drops, and becomes a cloud. "

                                                 Mole tied a string to Troll's tooth. He tied the other end to the bedpost. He sat next to Troll. He held his hand. They waited for the tooth to pop out. But nothing happened. Hmmm, said Mole. The Old Mole Family Way is not working. Troll looked worried. Mole thought again. Now I remember, he said. We tie the string to a chair. Then the tooth will come out-zing-o! Mole untied the string from the bedpost and tied it to a chair. He sat next to Troll. They waited. But the tooth did not come out. I know! cried Mole. I was all mixed up. We tie the string to the doorknob. Then I slam the door. And the tooth will come right out-presto! Stink-o! said Troll. I will not do that. That will really hurt. But, Troll, that is the real Old Mole Family Way. I promise it won't hurt. Promise crisscross applesauce? Promise crisscross applesauce. All right, Mole, said Troll. But I am not ready. Don't slam the door till I say \xfc\xbe\x8c\x93\xa4\xbcnow.' Mole tied the string to the doorknob. He opened the door. He sat next to Troll. He waited for Troll to say now. He waited for a long time. Are you ready yet? asked Mole. Please don't rush me, said Troll. So they waited some more. A breeze came through the door. The room got chilly. Troll got chilly. He sneezed loudly, KER-SNORT! Bless you, said Mole. Thank you, said Troll. That ith very nithe of you to thay. Thay? cried Mole. Let me see your tooth. Mole looked. The tooth was gone. Troll? asked Mole. Did that hurt? Not a bit, said Troll. What happened? You sneezed your tooth out. Troll smiled hugely in the mirror. That ith the New Troll Family Way, he said. That is a good way, said Mole. And you are a good friend, said Troll. It really helped to have you next to me. Yes, said Mole. That always helps a lot. Then they went to look for the tooth. "

         If someone asked you to draw a picture of a robot, how would it look? Like a person? That's how we often picture robots in our minds. But real robots look many different ways. Some robots have TV cameras for eyes. Some have special cells that help them touch. Many have computer brains. How robots look depends on the job they have to do. Some can even have their parts changed so they can do different jobs. Some robots look like huge bugs. NASA sent Viking Landers to Mars in 1976. They moved around on the surface, picked up soil, and did experiments. Robots can do boring jobs. They can do dangerous jobs with fast-moving machinery. They can do messy jobs, such as spray painting. They can do jobs no person could do, such as picking up hot metal. Robots don't get bored. They don't get tired. They don't mind getting messy. Some people are afraid robots will take jobs away from people. But that doesn't have to happen. After all, people are in charge of robots. People must remember that robots are good at some things and humans are good at others. Some robots go around telling people that they don't have to be afraid of robots. These robots help people understand that robots can do dull, nasty jobs so people can do better ones."

Though he may not clap his furry paws, Still- He doesn't pack up and move away Oh no! He doesn't pack up and move away. Is a Polar Bear happy in the North Where blizzards blow and the sea rolls gray? Though he may not turn cartwheels for joy, Still- He doesn't pack up and move away Oh no! He doesn't pack up and move away. "

                                                                                                                             Miss Dinsmore lived all alone in a little gray house with a white front door. It's a nice little house, Miss Dinsmore said. But I wish it looked more cheerful. Maybe I should paint it a bright, pretty color. Then it will be as cheerful as cheerful can be. Miss Dinsmore went to the paint store. She saw lots of cheerful colors there- pink and blue and red and yellow and green. It was hard to choose. I know what to do, Miss Dinsmore said at last. I'll paint picture after picture of my house with all of these cheerful colors. Then I'll choose the one I like best. Miss Dinsmore set up her painting easel in the front yard and painted picture after picture of her little house. She painted a pink house. She painted a blue house. She painted a red one and a yellow one and a green one. She painted one with flower boxes under the windows. She painted doors and shutters in every color of the rainbow. She took each picture she painted into the house and hung it on the wall. All of my picture houses are pretty, said Miss Dinsmore. But I still can't decide which color will make my house look as cheerful as cheerful can be. And she went on painting pictures. One day, a neighbor came by while Miss Dinsmore was painting. What a pretty picture, the neighbor said. I like pictures of houses. You do? said Miss Dinsmore. I've painted picture after picture of my little house. Come inside and have a look at them. Miss Dinsmore's neighbor liked the pictures. I'll tell the whole town, she said. Everyone will want to see your pictures. It was true. Lots of people came to the little gray house to see the pictures. Miss Dinsmore served them tea. What pretty pictures, everyone said. And what a nice little house you have. It is a nice little house, said Miss Dinsmore. But I wish it looked more cheer- She stopped and looked around. Her little gray house was full of people looking at pictures, drinking tea, talking, laughing, and having fun. Miss Dinsmore smiled. It's a nice little house, she said again. And it's a cheerful little house, too-especially when good friends come to visit me. It's as cheerful as cheerful can be. "

All you need are a few things you can find in your kitchen and other corners of the house. Things like jelly glasses and coffee cans and pie tins. Spoons, toothpicks, and plastic baggies. Popsicle sticks and paper cups. Pits and seeds and other leftover parts of the foods you eat. And some potting soil and sand from the supermarket. Maybe your farm won't grow a carrot or an orange. But with enough sunlight and water and love, you should get a carrot plant or a small orange tree. And lots of other leaves, vines, and sprouts. Now try this. When you suck on an orange, or slurp a grapefruit, or pucker on a lemon, save the seeds. Soak them overnight in warm water. Next stick your finger up to your knuckle in a pot of soil. Make a few holes like that and drop a seed into each hole. Be sure to plant the seeds about one inch apart or they won't have room to grow. Gently push the soil to fill up each hole. Water it all slowly until the soil is all wet and some trickles out the bottom of the pot. You have to trick these seeds into thinking they're home in the tropics or they won't grow at all. So keep them in the sunniest window and give them a rainstorm when they feel dry. Not every seed will believe you and sprout. But in two weeks, you'll find out just how many fruits you can fool."

Grandma took Abby fishing at the lake. I'm going to catch a big fish for dinner, Abby said. She swung her fishing pole, but her line didn't drop into the water. Where did it go? Abby asked. Grandma pointed to a tree. If you want to catch dinner for us, Grandma said, you have to get your line in the lake first. Abby giggled while Grandma untangled her hook from the tree. Abby swung her fishing pole again. She smiled when her hook hit the water. Grandma shook her head. If you want to catch dinner for us, Grandma said, you have to bait your hook next time. A worm wiggled between Grandma's fingers, and Abby giggled. I caught a fish! shouted Abby. She reeled in her line, but her hook was full of grass from the bottom of the lake. Grandma removed the grass and put a worm on the hook. Abby swung her fishing pole again and cheered when her hook dropped into the lake. If you want to catch dinner for us, Grandma said, you have to be quiet so you don't scare the fish away. Abby covered her mouth and giggled into her hand. I caught a fish! Abby shouted. This time when she reeled in her line, an old tin can hung from her hook. Grandma removed the tin can and put another worm on the hook. Abby swung her fishing pole again. She didn't say a word when her hook hit the water. Now you're going to catch dinner for us, Grandma said, winking at Abby. I caught a fish! A BIG fish! Abby shouted. She struggled to pull in someone's muddy sneaker. We can't eat grass, a tin can, or a sneaker for dinner, Abby said. Grandma laughed. If you want to catch dinner for us . . . she began. Abby exclaimed, You'll have to take me to the nearest grocery store! "

                                                      It was a cold winter morning on February 22, 1732. This was more than 200 years ago. Inside a Virginia farmhouse where it was warm and cozy, a special baby boy was born. The baby's name was George Washington. As little George grew up, he loved the farm and all of the animals. He loved his horse best of all. George had two older brothers who lived away. He lived with a younger sister and three younger brothers. They followed George's every move. Let's play Follow the Leader, said Betty. George is the leader, said John. Samuel and Charles agreed. George went to a small country school. He worked very hard. He was one of the smartest students. George was also the most honest boy in school. He grew up very fast. He was bigger and taller than all of the other boys. Everyone looked up to George. Sometimes George would choose games for his classmates to play. George is a natural-born leader, his schoolmaster would say. In school George liked to read and to write. He liked numbers. But he liked to make maps and measure land best of all. This is called surveying. George practiced by measuring the vegetable gardens on his farm. Many farmers wanted George to survey their land. It would help them to know how much seed to buy when it was time to plant their crops. George was only a boy of sixteen. But the farmers trusted him. They knew George was very smart and honest. He will do a perfect job, one farmer said to another. George's big brother, Lawrence, took him on a surveying trip in the Virginia wilderness. They stayed many cold and rainy days and nights. There were many wild animals. George learned how to take care of himself in the woods. Living in the wilderness helped George to become an even greater leader. ** * Americans will never forget the first president of their land."

         How shall we go to Grandma's house? Shall we jump on a bike? Shall we take a train, or go there by bus, or maybe by plane? If we lived a long time ago, of course, we'd go to see Grandma by donkey or horse. If we lived in the future, we'd go there by rocket and bring Grandma a star in our space-suit pocket. How shall we go to Grandma's house? We could take the car, but let's use our feet. Grandma just lives a block down the street! "

rainy, gloomy day again and there's nothing to do. You don't feel like sitting quietly but you're not allowed to make a lot of noise. What can you do for fun? Try balloon volleyball. Items needed for this game: a balloon (or two, in case the first one bursts) some string or yarn two chairs at least two people and a room Set up the room. If you're in the living room, or a family room, be sure to move all the furniture out of the way. Get two chairs and set them in the middle, outer edges of the room. They should be at the same place you would put a volleyball net. Turn them so that the seat is facing the wall, not the playing space. Tie the string or yarn onto the top of one chair, and run the rest of the string to the other chair. Now tie it on this chair at the same place as the first chair. You can decide the out-of-bounds lines, if you want to have them, but they really are not necessary in this game. Blow up the balloon. Choose sides. You will play this game on your knees (at least until they start hurting and you want to stand). Each side must get the balloon over the string in three hits. If it does not get over, the other side gets the balloon and a point. This game becomes more difficult because you must play without talking. You can also add other rules to make it more difficult; for example, you can only use your left hand or only your right hand to hit the balloon. Continue playing until one side gets 10 points. You can make your game longer or shorter by changing the number of points it takes to win. This is a fun way to get your energy out, have fun, and not make too much noise on a rainy, stay-in-the-house day! "

          The book Chicks & Chickens tells about chickens. Most chickens live on farms where female chickens, called hens, lay eggs. This part of the story tells what happens to the eggs. Many farmers raise hens to lay eggs. Some breeds of hens lay white eggs. Others lay brown eggs. A few breeds lay green or blue eggs. A hen usually lays no more than one egg a day. After the hen has laid all her eggs, she sits on them gently, turning the eggs over now and then, keeping them warm all over. Warming the eggs is called incubation. The mother hen incubates her eggs for about 3 weeks. During this time, a chick is growing inside each egg. When the incubated eggs are about 3 weeks old, the brooding mother hears a cheeping sound. The eggshell of one of the eggs begins to crack. A chick using its egg tooth, a sharp part of its beak, is breaking out of its shell. The other eggs begin to hatch, too. At first the chicks are wet and sticky. They are very tired. Soon they dry and have fluffy yellow feathers called down. They become stronger. They can see and hear and begin to move about. The chicks make a cheeping sound to let their mother know where they are. The mother hen clucks and drops food in front of them. Chicks can eat the same food as their mothers. In a few weeks the chicks are bigger, but their mother still protects them. The chicks have grown feathers. In a few months these young chickens will look like their mother or father."

                      If it was sunlight shining, I'd know that it was day, I'd gobble down my breakfast, then hurry out to play. If it was sunlight shining, I would not be indoors, I'd race around the garden, I'd fill the air with roars. If it was sunlight shining, I'd be a chimpanzee, I'd run, I'd jump, I'd tumble, I'd clamber up a tree. But it is moonlight shining, my eyes are getting red, my head is full of cobwebs, and I am off to bed."

Do you know why? Ocean water is full of salt-and salt water can hold up more weight than fresh water. See for yourself! (Ask an adult to help you.) You Will Need: 3 cups warm water Measuring cup Wide-mouth jar Salt Spoon Raw potato You Will Do: 1. Pour 1 12 cups of warm water into the jar. 2. Add 13 cup salt.3. Stir until the salt is completely dissolved. 4. Add another 1 12 cups of water. Pour it slowly over the back of the spoon into the jar so that the two liquids will not mix together.5. Gentlyplacethepotatointothejar. Do not drop it. What Will Happen: The potato will sink-but only halfway! Why? Salt water is heavier than fresh water, so it will stay on the bottom. The fresh water will remain on top. The potato is heavier than the fresh water, but it is lighter than the salt water. That is why the potato will sink only halfway down."

calendar. Ninety-eight, ninety-nine, one hundred! He jumps up and down. Yay! Tomorrow is Hundreds Day. What's Hundreds Day? asks his mom. We've been in school for one hundred days. We get to have a party. Everyone is supposed to bring one hundred of something to count and share. I need to find the absolutely most perfect thing ever! Harold opens cupboards in the kitchen. He finds a box of cereal. I could make a necklace out of one hundred pieces of cereal. His stomach growls. But what if I get hungry and eat the cereal off my necklace? Then I won't have anything to share. Harold runs into his bedroom. I know, he says. I bet I have more than one hundred rocks in my rock collection. He pulls out a big box from under his bed. Harold puts rocks in his pockets. He stands up. His pants sag. Uh-oh. These rocks are too heavy to take to school. Harold puts back the rocks and walks down the hall. I know, he says. My sister has over one hundred stickers. I can stick them all over me. He looks in his sister's room. Can I have some of your stickers for school? His sister shakes her head. Sorry. I'm taking them to school tomorrow for show-and-tell. Harold sighs. He walks all around the inside of the house. He walks all around the outside of the house. Finally he sits down at the kitchen table. Time is running out, he says. And I still need to find the absolutely most perfect thing ever to take to school. Then he sees the grocery list on the wall. Maybe I should make a list to help me think. He starts to write. I bet I have over one hundred ideas, says Harold. But none of them is the absolutely most perfect thing ever. He puts his head down on the table. All at once he gets another idea. The absolutely most perfect idea ever. He finds an old white shirt in the rag basket. Mom, may I write on this old shirt? he asks. Why? asks his mom. It's for school. For Hundreds Day. OK, says his mom. He gets a black pen. He starts to write. He writes and he writes and he writes. Harold takes his shirt to school the next day. Harold, please show us what you brought for Hundreds Day, says the teacher. Harold pulls his shirt out of a bag. He puts it on and turns in a circle. I couldn't make up my mind, says Harold. So I brought one hundred ideas. "

The rabbits who lived there were called lop-eared because their ears drooped down around their faces. They were all very proud of their long, floppy ears. One young rabbit in Lop-Eared Rabbit Village was not so happy. His ears were different. They stood straight up. Everyone teased him and called him Sticks. Be proud. Your grandfather had ears just like yours, his mother often said to him. But Sticks didn't like looking different. He wanted his ears to be long and floppy like everyone else's. "

Do you like to sleep in a hotel, go shopping, and eat fancy meals? If so, Mona Island might NOT be the place for you! That's because Mona Island has no hotels, no museums, no shops, and no restaurants. None at all! But if you like nature, Mona Island is an amazing place to take a vacation. Some of the animals living there are not found anywhere else in the world. There are beautiful beaches and caves to explore. The sea around the island has colorful fish. There are many things that make Mona Island an unusual place. Why Is Mona Island Unusual? Mona Island is very small. On a map it looks like a tiny green lima bean floating in the big blue ocean. The only way to get there is by taking a long boat ride from the island of Puerto Rico. The government of Puerto Rico takes care of the island and has made it a natural reserve. That means the island's animals and plants are protected from being harmed by people. Mona Island is different from most places because people are not allowed to live there. Only a few park rangers are able to stay. The park rangers' job is to keep Mona Island safe and beautiful. They insist that rules be followed. One rule is that only 100 people at a time can visit the island. That way, the park rangers can make sure the land and animals remain safe. Visitors to Mona Island must prepare wisely for their trip. Visitors can sleep only in certain areas and must bring their own tents. And if they want anything to eat or drink, they have to bring that along too. But people who take the trouble to come to Mona Island are rewarded with many wonderful sights.What Is There to See on Mona Island? One thing that most people enjoy is getting to see the Mona Island iguana. This type of reptile grows to be about four feet long and lives only on Mona Island. It has scales that look like horns on top of its nose. The huge muscles on its face droop down and look like fat cheeks. It likes to lie around and warm itself in the sun. Almost 2,000 of these iguanas live on Mona Island. Several types of sea turtles also live on Mona Island. They nest along the white sandy beaches. Some of these turtles weigh as much as 600 pounds. That\031s almost as heavy as two refrigerators! People also come to the island to get a close-up view of many kinds of fish and other sea life. Visitors can scuba dive and snorkel in the crystal-blue waters. They wear masks and special equipment to be able to breathe underwater. They can swim far below the surface. The water is almost transparent. Through the clear water, divers can see the bright colors of the fish. Visitors can also explore caves. Some of the caves even have paintings and drawings on the walls. This artwork was made by the Arawak and Tai\001no Indians who lived on the island hundreds of years ago. After a full day of fun activities, visitors can settle in, listen to the night sounds, and view the stars in the huge sky. The night sky is a stunning sight. Because the island is far away from other places, it is surrounded by darkness, and the stars are easier to see. Visitors say that watching the stars is amazing. It's the perfect end to a perfect day."

                                                                        There was no doubt about it. The new kid who was moving in next door to Jason was good. Jason sat on the front steps of his house. He had watched in he park was filled with kids, some riding on skateboards and others on skates. Several guys waved to Jason as he showed Amanda around. Soon, though, Amanda was showing everyone what she could do on her skateboard. Sometimes she looked as if she were flying in the air. Jason began to panic when he realized that all his friends had stopped skating and were watching her, especially his best friend Patrick. Jason wondered if he could sneak out of the park without anyone noticing. That's awesome! Patrick said, skating over to Jason. Just moved in next door to me today, Jason said. Do you think I could learn some of those tricks? Patrick wondered aloud. I always crash when I try to flip my skateboard like that. Jason took a deep breath and motioned Amanda over to him and Patrick. If Patrick judged Amanda on her skating abilities rather than on the fact that she was a girl, then things would be all right. Jason just hoped that Patrick would decide Amanda was O.K. As Amanda skated up to the two boys and took off her helmet, Jason tried to think of what to say. Before he could open his mouth, Patrick said, Wow, I never met a girl who could skate like that-or even a boy! Can you teach me that flip trick?admiration as the new kid jumped out of the movers' truck that was parked in the driveway and right onto a skateboard. Wearing a bright red helmet and knee and elbow pads, the kid had traveled quickly down the sidewalk in front of Jason's house, weaving around anything in the way. As Jason watched, Mrs. Tuttle's fluffy little white dog suddenly ran out onto the sidewalk. The kid jumped his skateboard over the ball of fur and flipped the skateboard up into his hands, just like a professional. Then he grabbed the leash and set off to return the runaway dog. Wow! Jason exclaimed. I need to learn how to do those cool tricks! After returning the dog to Mrs. Tuttle, the kid rode his skateboard back to his house. Jason saw the kid make his way between workers who were carrying boxes and chairs into his new home. Jason felt shy about talking to the new kid, but he wanted to find out where that kid had learned to skateboard so well. Jason sat on the porch steps, waiting for the kid to come back out. When he did, he was still wearing his helmet and other gear, and he was carrying the skateboard under one arm. Jason got up his courage and walked over to the new kid. Hey, I saw you riding your skateboard, Jason said. You're good. The kid smiled and quietly said, Thanks. Where are you from? Jason asked. California, the kid answered. Jason nodded and said, My name's Jason. The helmet came off, and Jason watched long brown hair tumble down. The kid said, I'm Amanda.Jason almost swallowed his gum. The new kid was a girl! After a few seconds he finally managed to say, Hi. My mom told me that there's a skate park in the neighborhood. Is that right? Amanda asked. Jason shrugged. He knew Amanda was really good at riding a skateboard, and he could learn some things from her, like that flip she had just done. But he didn't want his friends to know he was learning something from a girl. His friends would tease him forever! Then he had an idea. It's not too far, but you have to wear your helmet and knee and elbow pads, Jason said. No problem, Amanda said. Let me ask my parents if I can go. As Amanda ran inside to get permission from her parents, Jason stared down at his feet. If she can just keep her helmet on, everything will be fine, he thought to himself. Amanda came running out of her house, and she and Jason stopped by his house so he could get his gear and his parents' permission. Then they rode away. "

                                                                                                                                                                           Patrick woke to a loud whump-whump-whump. He had just turned ten and thought he was pretty brave, but his heart was pounding. It was very dark in his room at the cabin, not like his room at home. As he reached for the lamp, he heard the sound again. He quickly switched on the light and sighed in relief. Buffy's tail was beating against the floor. He had forgotten about Buffy. Patrick wasn't used to dogs. His parents had always said pets were too much of a burden and a lot of work. His family was busy and didn't think they could care for an animal. But a week ago Uncle Jack had pleaded with Patrick's parents to keep Buffy until he returned. Uncle Jack would be working in another country for six months and couldn't take Buffy with him. He had promised that Buffy would be no trouble. Surprisingly, Patrick's parents had agreed to keep her, even though they were about to leave for the lake cabin. At breakfast Patrick shared his scary story with his parents. Do you see the trouble a dog can cause? his mother asked. Pets like company. After breakfast take Buffy outside to play. Your father and I have some repairs to make on the cabin. Soon Patrick went out the door toward the lake behind the cabin. Buffy followed Patrick like a shadow on a sunny day. Patrick's father watched them go. Looks like Buffy may be a good pet, he said. We'll see, Patrick's mother grumbled. Patrick and Buffy spent the morning running and playing. Patrick's new friend showed that she could roll over, fetch a stick,and even play tag. The sun had warmed the air, and Patrick said to Buffy, Maybe we could cool off in the lake. Mom and Dad can see us from the cabin. When he got to the lake, Patrick was a little hesitant. He hadn't visited the cabin since last year, and he wasn't a very good swimmer. His mother had told him he could wade in the water up to his knees. So after thinking it over for a while, he decided to go in the lake. After all, he wasn't alone. Buffy was with him. The two friends jumped and splashed together in the lake. Patrick threw a stick, and Buffy retrieved it. No matter where Patrick threw it, Buffy swam after it like a trained athlete and returned it every time. Patrick was having so much fun playing with Buffy that he didn't realize he was so far from shore. Suddenly, the bottom of the lake seemed to disappear beneath his feet, and he went below the surface of the water. Patrick sank like a rock to the bottom of the lake. When his feet finally touched squishy mud, he pushed up with all his might. He struggled to get to the top. His face came out of the water, and he rolled over on his back to float. Help! he cried. His body was too tired to move. Just when Patrick felt hopeless, he heard a bark. He turned his head to see Buffy swimming toward him. She grabbed Patrick's shirt and began to swim, pulling him toward the shore. Patrick was relieved when his feet could touch the bottom of the lake again. He slowly started walking toward shore and saw his mother running from the cabin. Patrick! Are you O.K.? she screamed. Patrick could only nod and wave.Patrick's mother ran into the water and walked with him to shore. When they reached dry ground, Patrick sat down to catch his breath. Buffy sat on one side of him, and his mother sat on the other. Patrick looked up at his mother and then hung his head. In between breaths he said, I'm sorry, Mom. I got busy playing with Buffy, and I forgot to be careful. Patrick's mother wrapped one arm around Patrick, and with the other she reached out to pat Buffy. I'm sorry, too, she said, smiling. And I'm glad your uncle left Buffy with us. She's a good lifeguard. I guess she's not really that much trouble."

learned that Mrs. Reno would be my fourth-grade teacher. She had a lizard in her classroom, and lizards were on my list of terrifying things. And it wasn't a little lizard. It was a Uromastyx, as long as my arm and with a spiky tail. Worse, Trent Dillard was in my class again. Last year, I had to sit in front of him because Amy Carlson comes before Trent Dillard in alphabetical order. He knows I'm afraid of spiders, and all year he pretended to put them in my hair. If he found out lizards were on my list, I'd be finished. On the first day of school, I tried not to look at the terrarium1 in the corner, but Mrs. Reno pulled out the lizard and set him against her shoulder like a baby. This is Ripley, she said. Trent whispered, Bet you're scared of him. I am not! I said. Mrs. Reno looked toward Trent and me. What's wrong? she asked. Amy's scared of Ripley, Trent announced. No, I'm not. My chest tightened. I love lizards. They're my favorite animals. Mrs. Reno smiled. I was going to ask for a volunteer to feed Ripley at recess, but since you're a lizard lover, how would you like the job? She probably thought I was speechless with joy. Before recess, Mrs. Reno gave me instructions. You can hold Ripley, but don't keep him away from his heat lamp too long.She showed me Ripley's bag of greens. I can handle that, I told myself. I'll just lift the terrarium lid, drop in the greens, and run. As Mrs. Reno led the class out the door, she said to me, Tomorrow I'll bring in live crickets as a treat for him. I was frozen in a block of ice. I wanted to cry, but my tears were frozen, too. Ripley sat still, watching. I knew he was waiting to jump at me the second I lifted the lid. I just stood there for a long time, staring back at Ripley. Voices in the hall told me recess was over. I closed my eyes, lifted the lid, threw in the greens, and slammed the lid shut. Mrs. Reno said, You must be enjoying your job, Amy. You didn't come out for recess at all. Trent's eyes got wide. I'd fooled him. But now I'd have to spend every recess with a lizard. The only way I got the nerve to dump the crickets in the terrarium the next day was by picturing Trent putting them in my hair if he found out I was scared. My heart raced when I lifted the lid, but I shut it so fast Ripley never had a chance to jump at me. Maybe I could survive this, as long as I didn't have to touch that slimy lizard. After a few weeks, Trent said, Why does Amy always get to feed Ripley? I want a turn. A way out! Mrs. Reno said, OK. I guess Amy can have an assistant. I was doomed. \xfc\xbe\x8e\x96\x84\xbc 2009 Highlights for Children, Inc., Columbus, Ohio.Reading Page 4 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 After the class left, Trent raised the lid and grabbed Ripley. Careful! I cried, surprised that I was worried about the slimy monster. Trent held Ripley while I slowly arranged greens in the terrarium. Trent looked out the window. Hey, the guys are playing football. Take Ripley. A shiver ran over my skin. You can just put him down. I meant for Trent to put him down inside the terrarium, but Trent set him on the floor and ran outside. What now? Ripley walked toward the door. I took a deep breath and grabbed Ripley. He wasn't slimy. His skin was dry and cool. And he didn't jump at me. He crawled into the crook of my arm. You're not so bad, I whispered to Ripley. The next day, I held him again. Soon, I was even letting him sit against my shoulder. Tonight I pulled out my list of terrifying things and officially crossed off lizards. I thought about it, then crossed off crickets. Spiders were next on my list. Hmm . . . I decided I'd crossed off enough things for one year."

"1"," Growing up, Norman Bridwell was not considered a very good artist. But he loved to use his imagination to draw. Although many people didn't think his art was The big red dog has appeared in more than just books. In the late 1990s a giant-size Clifford balloon was in a famous parade in New York City. In 2000, Clifford the Big Red Dog became a popular cartoon television show. In 2004, Bridwell's famous dog came to the big screen in Clifford's Really Big Movie. Clifford's image can also be seen on everything from puzzles to backpacks and clothes. Bridwell has written and illustrated many other books for children that do not include Clifford. Bridwell says he's also written other books that have not been accepted by publishers. Bridwell doesn't let the rejection stop him. He tells children who like to write or draw not to give up. If you like doing it and keep working at it, then someday you will succeed, Bridwell says. He speaks from experience. Without Bridwell's determination and passion, the world would never have been introduced to Clifford the big red dog. good, Bridwell did not let it bother him. Bridwell once commented, In school, there was always someone better than me; the art teacher always liked their work better than mine. Bridwell loved art so much, though, that he decided to make it his career. He attended art school and later moved to New York to take even more art classes. He found a job drawing cartoons for filmstrips, but soon he needed to earn more money because he was married and had a child. Bridwell needed a better job so that he could support his new family. He displayed his art in a special book called a portfolio and tried to find work drawing pictures for children's books. Bridwell showed his portfolio to about 15 companies that publish children's books. None of the companies hired Bridwell to draw pictures for their books, but an editor at one of the companies offered him some advice. She told him to try writing his own stories. She looked through his portfolio again and stopped at a picture of a baby and a red dog that was the size of a horse. She told Bridwell to think of a story that would match that picture. Bridwell didn't waste any time. He went home and wrote a story about a huge red dog and the little girl he belonged to. This time when he drew more pictures, he made the dog as big as a house! He named the girl Emily Elizabeth, after his daughter. He called the dog Tiny because he thought it would be a funny name for such a big dog. But his wife thought that Clifford was a better name, so Bridwell changed it. Then he took his story and artwork to another publishing company and hoped for the best. Three weeks later Bridwell got a phone call. The publisher wanted to print Clifford the Big Red Dog! At the time, Bridwell probably had no idea that his Clifford would become the most loved big red dog of all time! Since the book was first released in 1963, Bridwell has created more than 80 books about Emily Elizabeth and the big red dog. More than a hundred million copies of Clifford books have been printed all over the world and in 13 languages. In some countries Clifford's name isn't even Clifford.

                                                                 Never say never. This is a quotation that Conner Long lives by. Conner is a young boy who has two great loves: sports and his younger brother Cayden. Conner always wished Cayden could play sports with him. But Cayden has cerebral palsy, a movement disorder. As a result, he is unable to walk and talk without help. Cayden uses a wheelchair to move around, and he communicates using sign language. Conner thought they might not ever be able to play sports together. But that all changed in the spring of 2011 when Conner, age seven at the time, saw an advertisement for the Nashville Kids Triathlon. Getting Ready A triathlon is a sporting event in which athletes swim, bike, and run. When Conner saw the advertisement, he knew right then that he wanted to participate, and he wanted Cayden to participate with him. The boys' mother talked to race officials about Conner's idea. The request was unusual because children who have special needs usually compete in triathlons with the help of a parent. However, the race officials allowed the boys to compete together. The next step was to find a coach who could help the boys prepare for the triathlon. The boys' mother contacted Mandy Gildersleeve. Coach Gildersleeve had trained children with special needs before. She helped Conner and Cayden get the special equipment they would need. Then she focused on working with Conner to help him become stronger. The Big Day The boys' first triathlon began with a swim. Conner entered the swimming pool. Then he pulled Cayden on a raft behind him for the 100-yard swim. Conner held the rope in one hand and paddled with the other. Cayden smiled and laughed the whole way. Next came the biking part of the race. Conner rode his bike for 3 miles. At first Gildersleeve raced alongside Conner, pulling Cayden in a special trailer behind her bike. Conner did not like this situation. Conner wanted to pull Cayden himself, and Cayden wanted to be with Conner. After the last large hill, Gildersleeve attached the trailer to Conner's bike so he could pull Cayden himself. After that he just took off, Gildersleeve said. The final part of the race was the run. Conner ran while he pushed Cayden's trailer the entire half mile. The boys completed the race in 43 minutes 10 seconds. Conner was thrilled when they finished. Later he told reporters, Everybody wants to win, but it's not all about winning. Really it's all about fun. More Races Both boys take great pleasure in being involved in the events, but the family needs to plan in order for the boys to continue racing together. As Cayden grows older and bigger, his equipment will need to grow, too. The Longs participate in fund-raising events to raise money for Cayden's equipment. Conner and Cayden want to someday participate in the Ironman World Championship competition in Kona, Hawaii. It is one of the most difficult races in the world. They will be grown men when they are old enough to compete. Until then all the races the boys participate in over the years will help prepare them for it. In 2012 a sports magazine named Conner and Cayden Sportskids of the Year. The boys' experience certainly shows what can happen when you never say never! "

You carry my treasures for me. When I find grass on your knees and sand in your pockets, I know where I've been. We go everywhere together except the washing machine. Don't let them put me in there! you beg. Or at least come with me! But all I can do is watch you go round and round in the little window, tumbling in the suds, like me when I'm caught in an ocean wave. I hear your buttons clicking in the spinning dryer. You emerge, limp and lifeless, till I slip my legs inside you. You're alive again! Eager for our next adventure! when I'm caught in an ocean wave. 25 I hear your buttons clicking in the spinning dryer. You emerge, limp and lifeless, 30 till I slip my legs inside you. You're alive again! Eager for our next 35 adventure!"

Or have you ever hiccupped so hard that you had to stop what you were doing? If you have ever made the familiar hic sound of hiccups, you are not alone. Hiccups are a problem that almost everyone has experienced. What Is a Hiccup? Hiccups start in your diaphragm. The diaphragm is a muscle between your chest and your abdomen. When the diaphragm suddenly tightens, air strikes the vocal cords. This creates a single hiccup with its hic sound. For most people a case of hiccups will stop after a few minutes. People get hiccups for a variety of reasons. Hiccups might result from eating or drinking too much or too quickly. A sudden change in the stomach's temperature, such as from drinking hot liquid immediately after cold liquid, may also cause hiccups. They may even occur from being excited or being under a lot of stress. Making Hiccups Go Away Ideas on how to stop hiccup shave been created, shared, and tried for years. However, what works for one person to cure hiccups may not work for everyone. Perhaps the most common method people use is to hold their breath for a few seconds. If this doesn't work, you can try swallowing hard while briefly holding your breath. There are also some strange-sounding ways to cure hiccups, like drinking a glass of water upside down. Someone might even try to scare away your hiccups. Some people believe that getting startled causes you to focus on something other than your hiccups, which may relax the muscles in your throat and cure your hiccups. Ideas for curing hiccups often include ingredients found in the kitchen. Some homemade recipes combine water with sweet and sour ingredients. They may include saltwater or pickle juice. Many people believe that eating a spoonful of sugar can make hiccups go away. So the next time you have the hiccups, try looking in your kitchen for something that will help get rid of them. Award-Winning Recipe In 2010 a young girl named Mallory Kievman couldn't make her irritating hiccups go away. None of the ideas that she researched worked for her every time. So she decided to find her own cure for hiccups. She knew that sweet and sour ingredients were commonly used to cure hiccups, and she knew that swallowing hard could also be effective. She decided to use the two ideas to make a special lollipop. She thought that the sweet and sour ingredients combined with sucking on a lollipop would cure her hiccups. She experimented with different recipes in her family's kitchen. After many failed attempts Mallory invented a lollipop that worked by combining water, sugar, and apple-cider vinegar. She named her invention Hiccupops. Mallory wanted to find out whether her lollipops would help others cure their hiccups. She gave her lollipops to friends and family members. Mallory found that most of them were cured of their hiccups after sucking on the lollipop. Mallory entered her lollipop in a competition for new inventions made by children. She won three awards for her creative idea, and a patent was filed for her product as part of her winnings. Perhaps one day you will see Mallory's invention in a store near you. "

                                                                                                                                                                                                                     A stationmaster is a person who keeps a train station running smoothly. At Kishi Station in western Japan, however, the stationmaster is not a person at all-it is a cat named Tama! As a kitten Tama was a stray without a real home. She spent most of her time at Kishi Station. A nearby grocery store owner gave her food. Although she had no real owner or home, Tama seemed to enjoy watching people at the station. Tama also enjoyed the attention and affection she received from passengers. In the early 2000s, the train company that ran Kishi Station was losing money. Not enough people were riding the trains. By April 2006 the company could no longer afford to pay the people who worked at the station. With no employees to help them, passengers now had to manage their own travel. Even though the employees were gone, Tama stayed at the station. She continued to greet train riders with a warm nuzzle and a purr. Soon visitors shared stories with others about the cat at Kishi Station. People wanted to see the sweet cat that was always on duty. The train company had fun with the unusual situation. It gave Tama the title of Kishi stationmaster. The job even came with a stationmaster's uniform. It is a simple black cap. Tama wears the hat every day at work. Instead of paying Tama with money, the company pays her with cat food. Perhaps Tama's title was originally meant as a joke, but Tama continues to perform her job wonderfully, like any hardworking employee. She walks around the station in her uniform and greets passengers. The black, white, and orange cat allows passengers to pet her and take photographs with her. People continue to visit the station just to see Tama. When people come to Kishi Station to meet Tama, they spend money on train tickets and gift items that will remind them of her. This helps the train station. The visitors that Tama attracts also help the town near the station. Visitors spend money at local shops and restaurants. The money from these purchases adds up. In 2007, Tama's presence brought about 10 million dollars to her region of Japan. Most importantly, this hardworking cat has helped the Kishi Station remain open and provide transportation for community members. Tama was such a good stationmaster that she was promoted. Now called the super stationmaster, Tama has her own small office. It is an empty ticket booth. Since Tama is getting older and now likes to nap more, she has been given two assistants that help her greet passengers. They are both cats, of course. Tama's fame continues to grow. Tama has been featured in many newspaper and magazine articles as well as on television shows and in video clips. There is even a picture book called Diary of Tama the Station Master, which includes photographs of Tama at work. From stray cat to famous stationmaster, life is sweet for Tama! "

                                                                                                                      Dr. Hunter Patch Adams decided early in his life that he wanted to help make the world better. Many of the patients who have visited his hospital would agree that he has done just that. Adams was born in Washington, D.C., but lived in many parts of the world while growing up. His father was in the army, so the family moved often. Moving to new places helped Adams become good at making friends and accepting people for who they are. As a child Adams performed well in school. He especially excelled at math and science. Above all, like most kids, Adams liked to play and have fun. Adams decided to become a doctor. During his medical training he developed his own style of working with patients. When he talked with sick people, he wanted to understand how they were feeling. He was friendly and thought of ways to make them laugh, hoping to make them feel better. Some of Adams's teachers were not pleased with his way of treating patients. These teachers believed that being friends with patients could get in the way of being a good doctor. Adams did not let his teachers' attitude stop him from trying to make patients laugh. One day he dressed in a clown costume. His bright clothes and red nose made patients smile. After that, Adams continued to wear silly costumes while studying to be a doctor. After he finished medical school, Adams and 20 of his friends opened their own hospital. They converted a large house with six bedrooms into a hospital, where they provided free medical care. They named their hospital the Gesundheit! Institute. Gesundheit means health in the German language. It is also a funny- sounding word, which makes it a perfect name for Adams's hospital. Like at all hospitals, the doctors and nurses at Adams's hospital worked to make sick patients well again. But Adams's hospital also provided fun activities for patients. They could garden and fish. They could watch a play or see a dance performance. Adams thought the patients would begin to feel better if they were engaged in things they enjoyed doing. The doctors and nurses at Adams's hospital were also trained to be funny and kind to patients. According to Adams, humor is very important. He thinks laughter and joy can sometimes help a sick person as much as any medicine. Some days Adams dresses as a clown and rides a unicycle through the halls of the hospital! He believes taking the time to be friendly and silly with people shows them that someone cares. In the 1980s, Adams took his red clown nose and left the United States to visit other countries. His goal was to make people around the world feel better by providing them with medical care. He hoped to make patients feel comfortable by talking with them and telling jokes. He also brought medical supplies to the places that needed them most. Whether Adams was giving medical care or supplies, he made sure there was always a friendly smile under that bright red nose! Cracking funny jokes and making people laugh is an effortless talent for some. However, it does not come naturally to everyone. For those doctors who feel they need help, Adams spends time teaching them how to be friendly and silly with their patients. He gives speeches all over the world, and he still wears a clown costume. The Gesundheit! Institute is raising money to build a teaching center and a bigger hospital. This hospital will also provide free care for patients. And of course, Adams wants it to be a fun and playful place. Adams has written books about his style of healing patients. He writes that you don't have to be a doctor to help someone feel better. The most important thing anyone can do is visit people who are sick. Sometimes letting someone know you care can be the most powerful cure of all. "

summer day. Up the bark that is brown and dark through tunnels of leaves that sway and tickle my knees in the trembly breeze, that's where I make my way. Leaves in my face and twigs in my hair in a squeeze of a place, but I don't care! Some people talk 15 of a summer walk through clover and weeds and hay. Some people stride where the hills are wide and the rocks are speckled gray. But the trunk of a tree is the road for me on a sunny summer day. "

name is Chelsea Chowderhead. A chowder is a stew or thick soup. My father says that our early ancestors may have invented chowder. I wonder if our early ancestors got made fun of all the time, too. For me, the last name teasing began as soon as I started school. So when my family moved to South Carolina, I decided that it was my chance for a fresh start. I asked my dad if I could change my name. But the Chowderhead name has a long and rich history-, Dad started. I know, I know. We were makers of thick soups or stews. Why do you want to change it? he asked. My dad always asks lots of questions. I didn't want to hurt his feelings, but I didn't want to go through another school year as a Chowderhead, either. I get teased all the time. Even a compliment like \xfc\xbe\x8c\x93\xa4\xbcGood idea, Chowderhead' sounds mean. I know it's not always easy being a Chowderhead, said Dad. I've been a Chowderhead my whole life, and I've been teased a lot. But you shouldn't change who you are. Let people get to know you first and your name later. How can people get to know me before they know my name? I asked. He said, Ask good questions. I looked at him blankly. He went on, When you meet someone new, ask them a question. It can't be a mean question, and it has to be something that you're really curious about. Once people start talking about themselves, they don't judge you. They're just happy that someone is interested in what they have to say. Two days later I headed to my new school for the first day of class. As soon as I got to my classroom, a girl named Claire introduced herself. I noticed that Claire was wearing pretty woven bracelets. I asked her where she got them. Her face lit up, and she explained that she made them herself. She'd gotten a bracelet-making kit for her birthday, and these were her first try. She offered to make me one. By lunch, I'd talked to lots of people and was getting the hang of finding the right question. But there were two kids, twin brothers, who didn't seem to talk to anyone but each other. When they looked at me, I felt as if they already knew that I was a Chowderhead. Still, my dad's advice had worked out well, so I decided to give it one more try. I asked Claire if we should sit with the twins. She looked a little surprised, but shrugged her shoulders and followed me. Do you mind if we sit with you? I asked. The twins stared at us. I sat down and opened my milk. No one said anything. I realized that if the twins never said anything, I'd never think of a question. Claire didn't say anything, either. I looked at their lunches for some kind of clue and noticed that the lunchboxes were identical. That's when it came to me. What's it like being a twin? I asked. The twins looked astonished. Then they both started talking at the same time. No one has ever asked us that! one said. Most of the time it's good, the other said. It turns out that being a twin is as complicated as being a Chowderhead. When you're a twin you always have someone to talk to and have lunch with, but people think that you're exactly alike. In no time at all we were laughing and talking. Then one of the brothers said, I'm Nicholas, and this is my brother, Nathaniel. What's your name? I gulped, took a deep breath, and said, I'm Chelsea Chowderhead. Chowder? Like the soup? asked Nathaniel. Yes, I replied, looking down and blushing. Like a thick soup or stew. Hey, cool. Do you and Claire want to come over after school and play basketball with us? Nathaniel asked. I'd love to, I said. Me too, Claire agreed. And that is how I learned to ask good questions and became friends with Nicholas and Nathaniel Noodlenoggin. "

Carolina in 1903. More than 100 years later, 12-year-old Arturo Valdenegro enjoyed his own kind of fame when a giant paper airplane that he helped design flew over the desert in Arizona. The Great Paper Airplane Fly-Off Arturo's adventure started with a contest called the Great Paper Airplane Fly-Off. It was organized by the Pima Air and Space Museum in Tucson, Arizona. The goal of the contest is to help children learn more about how airplanes fly and to encourage them to explore science and inventing. The rules of the contest say that all airplanes have to be constructed from one piece of letter-size paper. The paper can be folded and cut as many times as needed. But the finished plane cannot contain any glue, tape, staples, or paper clips. Arturo and about 200 other children ages 6 to 14 entered the contest. The winner of the contest would be the person who made the paper airplane that flew the farthest. The 2012 Great Paper Airplane Fly-Off had four rounds of competition. In the first three rounds, the children were put into small groups and took turns flying their planes. The plane that flew the farthest in each group was the winner of the round. Each winner went to the next round and repeated the same process. But the final round was different. The children did not fly their own paper airplanes. Instead, a paper-airplane Guinness World Record holder named Ken Blackburn flew each of the planes. Arturo's paper airplane flew the farthest. He won the contest. But winning was just the start of his adventure. As part of the contest, the winner's plane design was used to create a giant paper airplane. The museum brought together a team of experts to build a much larger version of Arturo's airplane, with Arturo's help. They used a similar design but with materials that could fly higher and farther than a small paper airplane. The team built the huge plane out of a strong type of paper. By the time the plane was finished, it was 45 feet long and weighed 800 pounds. They named it Arturo's Desert Eagle. The next step was to see whether the giant paper airplane could fly. At 800 pounds this plane was too heavy to throw like a typical paper airplane. Instead, a helicopter lifted the plane into the air with a strong chain. Once the plane reached a height of 2,703 feet, it was released over an open, unpopulated area in the desert. During its short flight the plane reached a speed of 98 miles per hour. Then it crashed into the desert. It was a messy landing, with broken parts scattered all over the ground. But because the plane flew for six seconds, the team had a reason to celebrate. The Museum Display Arturo's Desert Eagle will not be forgotten. A part of the wing and several other pieces are now on permanent display at the Pima Air and Space Museum. The museum plans to continue offering its paper airplane contest to young scientists. The museum hopes that Arturo's Desert Eagle will inspire young paper airplane designers to practice their skills. Just like Arturo, their winning designs may soar into history one day! "

       Owning a dog can be a lot of fun. But taking care of a dog is a lot of work. Dogs need their owners to walk them, feed them, and play with them. According to Cesar Millan, a dog owner also has to be a strong leader so that the dog knows that the owner is the boss. Millan should know. After all, he's known as the Dog Whisperer. As a young boy growing up in Mexico, Millan spent a lot of time at his grandfather's ranch. He loved watching the pack, or group, of wild dogs that roamed there. In fact, Millan spent so much time watching the dogs that he was given the nickname El Perrero. This means dog boy in Spanish. Millan also watched dogs in television shows and movies. His favorite show was about a dog named Lassie. As a teenager Millan dreamed of going to Hollywood to train animals for the movies. Millan came to the United States in 1990. He was 21 years old, alone in a new country, and had no place to live. A month after arriving in California, Millan found a job as a dog groomer. He calmed the dogs as he cleaned and brushed them. Many of the dog owners noticed this. Some even asked Millan if he could train their dogs in addition to grooming them. Soon Millan moved to another city and got a job washing cars. This wasn't Millan's dream job, so he decided to start his own business. Millan noticed that many people had trouble getting their dogs to behave. He knew he could help. He saved his money and bought a van. The van became an office on wheels, where he began his dog-training business. Millan was a hard worker. Sometimes he kept difficult dogs with him full-time for weeks in order to train them. Millan's success with the dogs got the attention and admiration of dog owners. Soon he had many dogs to train, and his business grew. In 1998 Millan opened the Dog Psychology Center, where he was able to help a greater number of dogs. The goal of Millan's center was to help dogs with behavior problems. Some of the dogs were brought there by their owners, but many of the dogs were strays. News of Millan's skills quickly spread. In 2002 he was mentioned in an article in People magazine. The article was about a famous movie director and his two dogs. The director told the magazine that his dogs used to bite. After Millan trained them, they were well-behaved. Through his dog training, Millan met many other famous people. These relationships led to a new job for Millan. The job wasn't training dogs to be television stars like Lassie. Instead, it was Millan who became the star! His reality show, Dog Whisperer with Cesar Millan, first appeared on television in 2004. Each episode features Millan working with a different dog and its owner. Millan uses exercise, discipline, and love in order to teach the dogs to behave. While training the dogs, Millan also trains the owners. Learning to be calm and strong helps owners show their dogs that they are the pack leader. Dogs usually respect the leader of their pack. In 2007, Millan moved the Dog Psychology Center to the mountains. The new location is so big that Millan was able to expand the size of the center. The center now has room for Millan to swim and hike with the dogs. More than 50 dogs can stay at the center at one time. Millan also travels to other cities to teach dog owners about dogs and about being a pack leader. Dog owners who can't go to see Millan in person can learn about his training methods in his magazine, DVDs, and books. Although he isn't training animals for movies the way he dreamed of doing as a child, it's easy to see that Millan enjoys what he does. His ability to train dogs and their owners proves that he is the leader of the pack. "

said Mrs. Pike. It was almost lunchtime, and Jenny Archer was starving. She drew a piece of apple pie in her notebook. Sometimes Mrs. Pike's exciting news wasn't very exciting. Once, Mrs. Pike had said it would be exciting to watch a filmstrip called Tommy Tooth and the Whole Truth About Teeth. But it wasn't. She had said it would be exciting to study how wheat is turned into bread. But it wasn't. Jenny drew a scoop of ice cream on the apple pie. We're going to have a contest, said Mrs. Pike. Jenny put down her pencil. She pushed her glasses back on her nose. The whole school will take part, Mrs. Pike went on. We're going to collect empty tin cans to sell to a scrap-metal dealer. We'll use the money to buy a video camcorder1 and a TV monitor for the school. What kind of contest is that? asked Clifford Stern. Just collecting cans? The class that collects the most cans, said Mrs. Pike, will use the camera first. We will make our own class movie. You could all be stars! Me, a movie star! Jenny thought. Now, that was exciting. She pictured herself accepting an Academy Award. She would say, It all started when I was in a little school . . . The person in the class who brings in the most cans will direct the first movie, Mrs. Pike finished. Wow! Directing a movie might be even better than starring in one. The director could make up the whole story. She would choose the actors and tell everybody what to do. Jenny loved to make up stories. And she was good at telling people what to do. She was sure she'd be a great director. The whole class was buzzing now. Jenny forgot she was starving. She looked over at her friend Beth. Beth's eyes were bright. She thought this was a great idea, too. You can be the star of my movie, Jenny whispered to her. What do you mean, your movie? Beth asked. When I win the contest, Jenny said. What if I win the contest? Beth said. But I have to win, answered Jenny. I've always wanted to make a movie. Since when? Well, I just realized it now, Jenny admitted. But don't you think I'd make a good director? I think I might make a good director, Beth said. Why should you be the director? Beth was one of Jenny's two best friends. Jenny didn't want to fight with her. But she really wanted to win this contest. She just had to direct the class movie. Yet, someday, when she was a famous moviemaker, she would still want Beth to be her friend. Let's not fight, Jenny said. We'd both be good directors. 27 28 29 You're right. Beth grinned. We won't fight. Let's just say, may the best can collector win. Jenny shook Beth's hand. May the best can collector win, she repeated. As long as it's me, she told herself."

metal bars as the merry-go-round spins. One child jumps off and gives his friends a push. This is not an ordinary merry-go-round, however. It's a PlayPump, and it's unlike the merry-go-round you may see at a park. These PlayPumps offer hope to people in southern Africa. Getting clean water in some areas of Africa is difficult. PlayPumps make it easier to get water needed for cooking, bathing, and drinking. This new water system can bring fresh, healthful water to many people living in southern Africa. A man named Trevor Field wanted to do something to help people in the parts of Africa where clean water can be hard to find. So he teamed up with an inventor, and together they created PlayPump. The way a PlayPump works is simple. Children push the merry-go-round, and the energy the merry-go-round makes helps draw water up from deep underground. The water then travels to a large tower, where it is stored in a tank. Finally the water is routed to a tap that controls the flow of the water. People in the community are able to use the tap to get the fresh water they need. Making sure the pumps work correctly can be expensive. However, Field found a creative way to help maintain them. Since the storage tank is tall and rectangular, he thought that all four of its sides could be used to advertise to the community or make public announcements. Two sides of the tank may show tips for good health, such as how to wash your hands. The other two sides show advertisements from businesses. These businesses pay to have their messages on the tank. The money they pay is used to help keep the pumps working properly. PlayPumps can be used in areas where there is already a water source nearby. The pumps are usually located near schools or community centers. This allows families to collect water whenever they choose. Having clean water close by helps families stay healthy. PlayPumps also give children a chance to play. People in southern Africa are excited about the PlayPumps. Not only do the pumps make clean water readily available, but the water is also easy to access. Several other companies have also decided to build and install these pumps in some countries in southern Africa. With PlayPumps, clean water just may be one spin closer. "

       Mom got a package, a great big package. Inside were these Styrofoam things. And I thought to myself, I just might fly if I made some Styrofoam wings. So I got myself some wrapping tape and a ball of old kite string. And I put those things upon my back, and I made myself some wings. My parents said, How very cute, 10 but, honey, they won't fly. I said, They might, they surely might. To know I'll have to try. My brother said, You nutty kid. You know those things won't fly. I said, I don't know that at all, and I won't until I try. And my little sister looked at me with great big trusting eyes. And she said, Please bring me something back from wherever you go fly. And then she said, Good-bye. I went outside and I flapped real fast, I watched as the larks went flying past, I jumped to give myself a blast, and then I started to fly at last. I flew through the sky above the trees, I fluttered along with the birds and the bees, I felt the cool of the gentle breeze, and I knew I could fly wherever I pleased. And all because I tried."

                                                                                                                             One spring morning Leonie Allan took her dog Rex for a walk. She thought the walk down the road and back would be simple. Instead, the walk changed her from pet owner to wildlife rescuer. Allan lives in an area of Australia where people often find wildlife grazing in their yards. While people living in the United States might find deer, raccoons, and skunks roaming their yards, people in Australia might see kangaroos. Allan's walk was uneventful that morning, but Rex was acting strangely afterward. As Allan worked in the yard, Rex kept looking down the road they had taken on their walk. Then he began standing very still, with his nose pointing toward what he wanted Allan to notice. Rex, a mixed breed, is part pointer. Pointers are dogs that naturally stand very still and point with their entire body in the direction of wildlife they see or smell. They are trained not to chase animals but simply to point to where they are. They are excellent tracking dogs and can find animals with their keen sense of smell. Allan became worried when Rex began pointing. When Rex left to investigate, Allan thought he might have found something dangerous. She called the dog back. But when Rex returned, in his mouth he had a joey, a baby kangaroo about four months old. Picking up an animal was unusual behavior for Rex, since he had not been trained to do so. Allan was surprised that Rex had picked up the joey so gently. The baby didn't appear to be afraid at all. He obviously sensed the baby 'roo was still alive, Allan said, and somehow had gently grabbed it by the neck, gently retrieved it, and brought it to me. Rex and the joey, which Allan named Rex Jr., spent the afternoon playing together. The joey was snuggling up to him, jumping up to him, and Rex was sniffing and licking him-it was quite cute, Allan told a newspaper reporter. Wildlife experts were amazed, too. Tehree Gordon works at the wildlife sanctuary1 where the joey was later taken. She was surprised that Rex had been so careful with the joey and knew to take it to his owner. She was also amazed that the joey was not afraid of Rex and did not think he was a predator. Rex Jr. was bottle-fed and raised at the wildlife sanctuary. A year and a half later, he was released back into the wild in an area where he could be monitored by workers at the sanctuary. His progress and release went well, Gordon commented. Now Rex Jr. is part of a group of kangaroos, called a mob, living a normal kangaroo life-thanks to Rex, a gentle dog that knew how to point. "

                                                                                                                 Many people will offer their home to a stray cat or dog. But few people would adopt a lost hippopotamus. Most wouldn't even know what to feed it. When disaster struck and a baby hippo got lost, it was fortunate to find just the right home. Hippos have their babies underwater. One day a mother hippo went into the Blyde River in Africa to give birth while the river was flooding. The rushing water moved so fast that it swept the newborn hippo away from its mother. No one knows how far the baby hippo traveled down the river before it washed up on the lawn of Tonie Joubert. Joubert was taking a walk. He was surprised to see a baby hippo lying next to the river. It's a good thing that the baby hippo was found by someone who could save its life. Joubert was a retired game warden.1 He had nursed many orphaned animals back to health. He knew the baby hippo was very young and weak. He carried the 26-pound animal into his house and named her Jessica.Newborn hippos need a special type of milk, and Joubert knew just how to make it. He mixed egg yolks and cream and fed it to Jessica from a bottle. She was very hungry and drank well. Joubert let Jessica sleep on his bed so that he could feed and take care of her throughout the night. Soon Jessica was healthy. Joubert knew that his experience with animals made him well qualified to care for Jessica. He decided to keep Jessica, and she became an official member of the family. At first Jessica lived in Joubert's house. She made friends with the family dogs and seemed happy. When she got bigger, Joubert moved her bed onto the back porch. Still, Jessica was able to wander in and out of the house as she pleased-that is, until she started breaking the furniture! By the time she was three years old, Jessica had grown so large that she broke a couch. Soon after, she broke another couch. Then she broke a bed. Joubert decided it was best to lock the back door when he went outside. That way he could be sure Jessica stayed off the furniture when he was not able to watch her in the house. But Joubert made the mistake of leaving the key in the lock. Within a week Jessica had learned how to turn the key and open the door. Even after Joubert removed the key, Jessica forced her way in. Finally, Joubert bought a superstrong security door. Now Jessica comes inside only when invited. Hippos are social animals, but no one can tell whether Jessica thinks she is human or thinks the rest of her family are hippos. Today Jessica is fully grown and spends time with other hippos. Some nights she will wander down to the river to visit wild hippos when they come by. Jessica is free to leave anytime, but it seems she would rather stay with Joubert and the dogs. Jessica's story has made worldwide news. People around the globe are interested in learning about her. She has appeared in a South African film. She has also starred in an Animal Planet TV special called Jessica the Hippo. Joubert has created a website with information about Jessica, and she even has a fan club. People from all areas of the world enjoy hearing about how Jessica's scary situation turned into such a positive one!"

          PLIP! Judy Moody woke up. Drip, drip, drip went rain on the roof. Blip, blip, blip went drops on the window. Not again! It had been raining for seven days straight. Bor-ing! She, Judy Moody, was sick and tired of rain. Judy put her head under the pillow. If only she was sick. Being sick was the greatest. You got to stay home and drink pop for breakfast and eat toast cut in special strips and watch TV in your room. You got to read Cherry Ames, Student Nurse, mysteries all day. And you got to eat yummy cherry cough drops. Hey! Maybe Cherry Ames was named after a cough drop! Judy took out her mom's old Cherry Ames book and popped a cough drop in her mouth anyway. Get up, Lazybones! said Stink, knocking on her door. Can't, said Judy. Too much rain. What? Never mind. Just go to school without me. Mom, Judy's skipping school! Stink yelled. Mom came into Judy's room. Judy, honey. What's wrong? I'm sick. Of rain, she whispered to Mouse. Sick? What's wrong? What hurts? asked Mom. My head, for one thing. From all that noisy rain. You have a headache? Yes. And a sore throat. And a fever. And a stiff neck. That's from sleeping with the dictionary under your pillow, said Stink. To ace your spelling test. Is not. Is too! See, look. My tongue's all red. Judy stuck out her Cherry- Ames-cough-drop tongue at Stink. Mom felt Judy's head. You don't seem to have a fever. Faker, said Stink. Come back in five minutes, said Judy. I'll have a fever by then. Faker, faker, faker, said Stink. If only she had measles. Or chicken pox. Or . . . MUMPS! Mumps gave you a headache. Mumps gave you a stiff neck and a sore throat. Mumps made your cheeks stick out like Humpty Dumpty. Judy pushed the cough drop into her cheek and made it stick out, Humpty-Dumpty style. Mumps! said Dr. Judy. I think I have the mumps! For real! Mumps! said Stink. No way. You got a shot for that. A no- mumps shot. We both did. Didn't we, Mom? Yes, said Mom. Stink's right. Maybe one mump got through. Sounds like somebody doesn't want to go to school today, said Mom. Can I? Can I stay home, Mom? I promise I'll be sick. All day. Let's take your temperature, said Mom. She took the thermometer out of the case. Cat hair? said Mom. Is this cat hair on the thermometer? She's always making Mouse stick out her tongue and taking the cat's temperature, said Stink. Mom shook her head and went to wash off the thermometer. When she came back, she took Judy's temperature. It's 98.6, said Mom. Normal! Faker, fakey, not-sick, big fat faker, said Stink. At least my temperature's normal, said Judy. Even if my brother isn't. Better get dressed, said Mom. Don't want to be late. Stink? You're a rat fink. Stink Rat-Fink Moody. That's what I'll call you from now on. Well, you'll have to call me it at school 'cause you don't get to stay home. Judy stuck out her cherry-red, no-mumps tongue at Stink. She was down in the dumps. She had a bad case of the grumps. The no-mumps Moody Monday blues. She, Judy Moody, felt like Mumpty Dumpty! Mumpty Dumpty without a temperature, that is."

Of course you do-everybody does. If your favorite snack food is potato chips, then you are like millions of other people. Crunchy, salty potato chips are one of the best-loved snack foods in the world. They are also one of the oldest snack foods. People have been enjoying them for more than 150 years. An Accidental Success Potato chips weren't invented on purpose. In 1853 a chef named George Crum fried some potatoes at a restaurant in Saratoga Springs, New York. The man who had ordered the potatoes said that they were too thick and sent them back to the kitchen. Crum made another batch. This time he sliced the potatoes thinner. He sent them out again, but the man still complained. After the fried potatoes were returned a second time, Crum became angry. He wanted to teach the dissatisfied man a lesson. This time Crum sliced the potatoes as thin as he could get them. The slices looked as thin as a sheet of paper. When the potato pieces were fried, they became so crispy that Crum thought the man would never be able to pick them up with his fork. But theman was very pleased with this tasty new dish. He ate every one of the crispy potatoes piled on his plate! Soon these new crispy fried potatoes became well known. They were added to the restaurant's menu. People referred to them as Saratoga Chips. When Crum later opened his own restaurant, he set a basket of chips on each table for customers to enjoy. Other restaurants began to serve them as well.5 6 From Restaurants to Store Shelves It was not long before people wanted potato chips without having to go to a restaurant to get them. In 1895 a man named William Tappenden started cooking potato chips in his kitchen in Cleveland, Ohio. He sold the potato chips to local grocery stores, making it easier for people to get chips whenever they wanted. At some stores the chips were kept in big wooden barrels. Storekeepers scooped the chips out and put them into paper bags for customers. In 1926 a woman named Laura Scudder thought of a better way to package the potato chips. Scudder put two sheets of wax-coated paper together to form a bag. She used hot irons to press the edges of the bag. The heat from the irons melted the wax enough to seal the edges on three sides. The bags were then filled with chips, and the fourth edge was ironed shut. Now the bags could be placed on shelves in stores for customers to buy.Over the years many more people began making and selling potato chips. Bigger and better kinds of packages were designed, and different flavors of chips started appearing. Cheese and onion was one of the first flavor combinations to be sold, as well as salt and vinegar. These flavors are still available today. Chips with Different Tastes Other kinds of chips can be found around the world. Instead of white potatoes, some people use bright-orange sweet potatoes or carrots. And for a different crispy treat, some chips aren't made from a vegetable at all but from rice or corn instead. Many different seasonings can be used to add flavor to chips. For example, there are chips flavored with tomato sauce and smoked beef. Others are flavored to taste like roasted chicken or lamb with mint. Maybe the most unusual chip flavor is used in China, where there's a chip that tastes like a blueberry! What an unusual history the potato chip has, from its accidental beginning in New York State to being perhaps the most popular snack food in the world. What do you suppose Chef Crum would think if he knew how his invention had ended up?"

I can't believe it's true! I saw her buying groceries, like normal people do! She reached for bread and turned around, and then she caught my eye. She gave a smile and said, Hello. I thought that I would die! Oh, hi . . . hello, Miss Appleton, 10 I mumbled like a fool. I guess I thought that teacher types spend all their time at school. To make the situation worse, my mom was at my side. So many rows of jars and cans. So little room to hide. Oh, please, I thought, don't tell my mom what I did yesterday! I closed my eyes and held my breath and hoped she'd go away. Some people think it's fine to let our teachers walk about. But when it comes to Saturdays, they shouldn't let them out! "

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Kwan, isn't that your art teacher? Halmoni said, pointing at a woman walking out of the grocery store. Kwan waved, and Mrs. Gibbs walked over to him and his grandmother. It's very nice to see you, Mrs. Gibbs said. Then she saw the cloths wrapped around the groceries Kwan and his grandmother were loading into their van. Oh, how beautiful! she exclaimed. Thank you. These are pojagi, or Korean wrapping cloths, Halmoni explained. Kwan and I embroider2 them together. Kwan looked away. Although he enjoyed helping Halmoni make the cloths, he didn't want anyone at school to know about it. In Korea, they are mostly used to wrap gifts or cover food. Kwan and I use them to carry our groceries, Halmoni continued. Kwan, you should bring your cloths to school tomorrow. Your classmates would enjoy seeing them. You have a unique skill, Mrs. Gibbs said. Kwan appreciated his teacher's comments, but he was hesitant. The kids might laugh at the idea of a boy who liked to stitch patterns with a needle and thread. He thought about the pojagi. His grandmother's wide smile showed how proud of him she would be for sharing this Korean custom. O.K. I'll bring some to class tomorrow, Kwan replied quietly. Kwan usually spent some time each evening working on a cloth, but that evening he did not. Halmoni sensed that something was wrong. Kwan, are you worried about tomorrow? she asked. Kwan stared at the floor. What are the other kids going to think? he said. This isn't the kind of thing they do for fun. Creating embroidered patterns isn't like playing an instrument or a sport. You're right, Halmoni said. It is different. But that is why it is so special. Then she brought out a fine cloth with detailed floral designs. When your grandfather and I were married, we received a gift from his mother wrapped in this cloth she made. In Korea gifts given in wrapping cloths are extra special because they are a symbol of love and good luck. Even though the cloths have many uses today, they also have a rich history, she explained. The next morning Kwan took several wrapping cloths to school. During art class his heart began to beat faster. He knew Mrs. Gibbs would eventually call on him. Just as he began to hope time would run out, he heard his name. As Kwan walked to the front of the room, his face felt hot. His hands trembled as he took the cloths out of his backpack. Kwan took a deep breath and began to tell the class about the cloths. Then he showed everyone how to use a needle and thread to stitch a tree design onto a cloth. His classmates just stared. When he finished, he saw a classmate's hand shoot into the air. Kwan held his breath as Mrs. Gibbs called on Greg. Wow, Kwan! I can't believe you did that by yourself, Greg said. That looks awesome.Then a student named Carrie spoke up. My sister is learning to sew in one of her high school classes, but she's not all that good, Carrie said. She brought home something she made the other day, and I couldn't even tell what it was! As Kwan listened to his classmates, he noticed that his forehead no longer felt hot. I thought you would be interested in Kwan's cloths, so I brought some extra material, Mrs. Gibbs said. Let's have Kwan show us how the cloths are used to wrap and carry things. Several students said they wanted to use a cloth to carry their lunch to school. Soon, though, they realized they would need more practice if they didn't want their sandwiches to end up on the sidewalk. Folding these cloths is another real talent, Mrs. Gibbs said, laughing as her cloth came undone. Kwan, you'll have to give us more lessons on cloth folding. This isn't as easy as it looks, David said. Kwan, you must be a professional wrapper! Kwan smiled as he walked around the room helping his classmates. "

                       You scampered down this well-worn path when you were just a pup. And as we grew, I ran with you. I struggled to keep up. My legs grew long. Your legs grew slow. You're happy now to walk, ignoring all those squirrels and birds you once would chase and stalk. And as we walk I think of all 10 the moments that we shared. The day we found you at the pound,1 you looked so small and scared. The times I fed you table scraps in spite of Mother's rule. The days you greeted me with joy when I came home from school. And as we walk this well-worn path, no longer running free, I hope I was as good to you as you have been to me. "

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Long before there were cowboys in Texas, there were vaqueros. A vaquero could tame a wild horse. He could stop a steer without using a rope. Vaqueros worked well with their horses and could perform amazing stunts. Caring for Cattle At one time, Spanish ranchers in parts of Mexico, Texas, and California owned huge herds of cattle. The cattle lived on large areas of land. And all those cows needed a lot of food. The animals were allowed to roam freely across the land so they could find enough food to eat. Caring for the cattle was a big job. Ranchers hired vaqueros to keep the cattle safe. Vaqueros spent long days in their saddles, riding their horses across the open land. They scared away any animals that might harm the cattle. And if a cow was injured or sick, it was the vaquero's job to help it. Spring was a busy time for vaqueros because that was when the calves were born. Each rancher sent a team of vaqueros to search for the new babies and their mothers. The vaqueros would bring the entire herd back to the ranch to be counted and sorted. Each team was responsible for searching a specific area. Together they would search hundreds of miles to find stray cattle. Sometimes the cattle were hard to locate among the rocky hills and in the small valleys. Which Cow Belongs Where? Once the cows and calves were found, it was the vaquero's job to bring all the cattle to a large fenced area so they could be counted. Getting cattle to move in one direction was not an easy job. Using their horses, the vaqueros worked together to surround the cattle. Then they herded the animals into the fenced area. Next the cattle were sorted and counted. Vaqueros checked the brand, or special mark, on a cow's body to tell which rancher owned it. Each calf would receive the same brand as its mother. Getting the Job Done Special tools and clothing helped vaqueros with their work. They wore sombreros to protect them from the sun, wind, and rain. Vaqueros tied a sarape to their saddles. They could use it to protect themselves in cold or wet weather and at night while they slept. The sarape also helped them herd the cattle. Vaqueros would swing their sarape over their head to get the cattle to move. Something vaqueros didn't wear while doing their job was a pair of boots. They usually worked barefoot or in sandals. A lariat was another important tool for vaqueros. It was used to catch cattle or animals that could harm the cattle, such as coyotes. If a vaquero roped a coyote, everyone knew he was good at his job. Every good vaquero needed a well-trained horse that could make quick, sharp turns. The horses were also trained to step in front of a cow that was trying to escape from the herd. And they could stop suddenly if the vaquero pulled back on the reins. Training the Cowboys of Texas Spanish ranchers didn't stay in Texas. When they moved to other areas, their cattle and the vaqueros often remained. The new settlers who moved into Texas didn't know what to do with the cattle. But the vaqueros did. The vaqueros worked with the new settlers and taught them how to care for cattle. Soon some of these settlers were able to do the same work as the vaqueros, but they became known by a different name-Texas cowboys. "

You may have seen a talking parrot on a TV show, in a movie, or even in someone's home. The parrot has learned to copy sounds that people make. Birds are not the only animals that can copy the noises they hear. Dolphins, bats, and some apes also mimic sounds. Now we can add elephants to this list of copycats. Dr. Joyce H. Poole is a zoologist. She studies the sounds of elephants. While she was in Kenya, she would hear strange noises made by Mlaika after sunset. Mlaika was a 10-year-old African elephant. Mlaika lived near a highway. Dr. Poole says, I could not tell the difference between Mlaika's call and the distant truck noise. She and other scientists studied Mlaika's sounds. It turned out that Mlaika was copying the sounds of the trucks driving by. Chirping Elephants Mlaika was not the only copycat elephant, Dr. Poole says. Calimero is a 23-year-old male African elephant. He spent 18 years with two female Asian elephants. Asian elephants make chirping sounds to talk with one another. African elephants usually do not make chirping sounds. But Calimero now does. He is copying his Asian elephant friends. Only a few other mammals, such as bats, dolphins, and humans, have learned to copy noises around them. Many of them seem to copy the sounds of friends to create a special bond. Dr. Poole says that elephants, too, need to form bonds with their family and friends. She says, They make sounds to communicate with each other. When they are separated, they use sound to keep in contact.Why would Mlaika copy trucks that she heard going by on the highway? Animals that are able to mimic sounds may enjoy practicing new sounds. When they are kept outside of their natural environment, they may copy unusual sounds. That may be why an elephant would copy the sound of a truck. Parrots, dolphins, humans, and elephants show that being a copycat is one way that animals and people make new friends and keep old ones."

He gives a friend on the ground the thumbs-up and launches into a cannonball. Boing! SPLASH! He comes up laughing. See, Taylor? I tell myself. It's easy. Fun. Four kids to go until my turn. At the front of the line, a girl in a pink suit giggles with her friend. Go! my little brother, Travis, yells to them. Let's jump together, Pink Girl tells her friend. The gigglers reach the sixth rung of the ladder before the lifeguard whistles. Just one at a time! she shouts. Pink Girl goes on alone, slowly. Will she change her mind, like I did last week? Will the lifeguard have to help her down the ladder while everyone stares? In front of me, Travis hops around like a monkey. Pink Girl jumps, her hair shooting out like a parachute. SPLASH! Three kids to go. Travis steps on my foot. Watch it! I snap. Sorry. He moves away, just as Pink Girl's friend does a first-class belly flop. My brother's face lights up. Did you see that? I don't answer. Only two kids to go. My stomach bubbles like a pot of oatmeal on the stove. You don't have to do this, I tell myself. But next week is the pool party, my brain argues. You'll be the only one who can't go on the diving board. The board clunks, and a girl dives gracefully into the pool. Life is so unfair. Travis is next. He scampers up the ladder and waves his skinny arms. Watch this! I close my eyes, then open them just in time to see him hop off the end of the board. He pops out of the water, grinning. I can't help smiling, too. Nothing scares that kid. The boy behind me taps my shoulder. It's my turn. I count the rungs as I climb. One. Two, three. Four, five, six. Seven, eight. Nine. Blue water stretches out in front of me. Kids are shooting off the waterslide at the other end of the pool. A boy runs across the concrete. A lifeguard blows her whistle at him. Everywhere, everyone is moving. Except me. What are you waiting for? demands a kid on the ground. I step forward. The water looks so far away. Then I see Travis standing by the lifeguard's chair, shivering. His eyes lock on mine. You can do it! he yells. That's what I've always told him: When he was learning to tie his shoes. Or write his name. Or ride his bike without training wheels. You can do it. 1534 35 36 I take a deep breath and step out into nothing. My body drops, my stomach rises. Then my toes slice the water and I plunge deep. I flap my arms and pull myself to the surface, where my face finds the sun. I DID IT! Travis is doing a happy dance. I climb out, dripping. Hey, I say, like I've been doing this forever. Let's go again. How long do we have to be patient? Thomas asked. As long as it takes, said Grandfather. This didn't sound good. Thomas scowled, scratched his arm, his head, his ankle. He shifted from one leg to the other. Observe, Thomas, how quietly they wait-the pelicans and our friend the heron. They don't wriggle and writhe, like some I could name. They don't have anything to do but wait. Thomas, I've said it before and I say it again, you are a restless boy. I know, Thomas said. Grandfather? Yes, Thomas? When you were a boy, were you restless? Grandfather tipped his head till his beard pointed at the sky. I'll cast my mind back. Thomas waited. Grandfather lowered his chin, looked into Thomas's eyes. I was, he said. Oh, good. Grandfather threw out their lines again, handed Thomas his pole. They went on being patient. They'd had a few strikes, but each time the fish got the bait and Thomas and Grandfather got nothing. All part of the game, Grandfather would say, calmly Thomas landed a blowfish. It came out of the water already starting on its defense. Breathing deeply, it began to puff up, swelling until it looked like a bubblegum bubble with spines. Thinks he looks pretty fierce, doesn't he, Grandfather? He does look fierce, for a fellow his size. Grandfather dropped the stiff little blown-up blowfish into the water, where it slimmed down and swam off as if nothing unusual had happened. They caught a flounder. Flounders are bottom fish, and mostly spend their lives buried in sand. Their eyes are on top of their heads, they are flat as plates, and the one they caught was too small to keep. Carefully, Grandfather slid it back into the water. Too bad. Flounder were good eating. Especially the way Grandfather prepared them. Thinking about Grandfather's cooking made Thomas's mouth water. You're a very good cook, Grandfather, he said. True. I'm getting kind of hungry. So am I, said Grandfather. He did not sound ready to quit. Thomas sighed and moved his rod gently up and down. They caught a ladyfish. These are not good eating. Grandfather was about to toss it back when the heron darted forward and took it right from his hand, then tossed his head up and set about swallowing. Thomas watched as the bony fish went down the bird's long neck. I'm glad we don't have to swallow whole fish that way, he said. So am I, said Grandfather. Suddenly Thomas's rod dipped. A fish flipped out of the water a long way off. Speckled trout, said Grandfather. A big one. Gently, now, Thomas. You don't want him to throw the hook. I'm trying, Thomas said, turning the reel as slowly as he could. He wished Grandfather would take over, but didn't ask. Grandfather believed it was every man to his own fish. Slowly, slowly, he reeled in his trout until it was close enough for Grandfather to scoop up with the net. He was willing to do that. By golly, Thomas! he shouted. Look at the size of him! Thomas, swelling like a blowfish, regarded his catch proudly. He'll have to go in the book, won't he, Grandfather? He certainly will. A page to himself, like the snook we caught. You caught. All right. I caught. But this is your fish, and you are the one to write him in the book. Oh, good, Thomas said happily. Now-let's go to it, said Grandfather. This crowd of trout is here, and we have to strike before they take off.... In the excitement, Thomas forgot to be tired. Side by side, he and his grandfather caught fifteen trout and had to send only three of them back to sea-to grow bigger and maybe be caught another day. Twelve good-sized fish. Grandfather would keep out enough for tonight and tomorrow's dinner, and freeze the rest for later eating. Thomas swallowed hungrily, thinking about dinner. All right, Grandfather said at last. Let's go home. Collecting their gear, richer by twelve speckled trout, they clanked back up the beach. "

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         One day, as Niel was strolling down the road, he spotted a snake trapped between two rocks. Niel hated seeing a creature in trouble. He pulled apart the rocks carefully so that the snake could slither away. I owe you a reward, said the snake. Hold out your hand. And the snake dropped a snake tooth into his palm. Wear it around your neck, he whispered, and you'll understand everything that animals say. But if you reveal your secret, the charm won't work anymore. I won't tell anyone, Niel assured him. The snake flicked out his tongue. Beware! Secrets are hard to keep, my friend. That night, lying on the cot next to his wife, Niel heard mice scurrying across the floor. Will we find any injera bread in this hut, I wonder? one mouse squeaked at another Niel sat up in surprise, clasping his charm. He could understand the mouse's squeaking. The people in this house never put food away correctly, replied the second mouse. We are going to feast like emperors. Niel couldn't help laughing. The poor mice would be disappointed. He and his wife had eaten everything. Why are you laughing, Niel? asked his wife. I can't tell you, replied Niel, remembering the snake's warning. In the morning, a milk seller knocked on the door of the hut. I hope that these people aren't foolish enough to part with their money, Niel heard one cat say to another. The master has watered down the milk. Niel laughed out loud again. Being able to understand animals seemed to have a lot of benefits. What's the big joke? asked his wife. Why can't you tell me? I have my reasons, answered Niel. And he refused to say anything else. Later that afternoon, Niel's old aunt came to visit, riding on her big cow. It's not fair, that woman riding on me in this heat, the cow complained to a stray cat. She's heavier than a cartload of mangoes. Niel tried hard not to giggle. Aunt Sora would be furious if she found out what the big cow was saying about her! I've had enough! fumed his wife. If you don't tell me what's making you laugh, I'm going home to my parents. Niel didn't want to lose his wife-he loved her too much. He told her his secret immediately, but his wife didn't believe him. Niel gave her the charm. Here, you try it. But the charm had stopped working. Niel's wife couldn't understand what the animals were saying, and when he put the charm around his neck again, neither could Niel. The fun was over! A few days later, Niel was resting under the mango tree when the snake slithered past. I see that you have revealed your secret, my friend. I did it for my wife, said Niel ruefully. True love should be rewarded, said the snake. Put out your hand again. The snake gave Niel a feather. Wear it around your neck, he said, and you will be able to understand everything that the birds say. But do not reveal the secret to anyone, or the charm will stop working. I've learned my lesson, said Niel. Nothing on this earth will make me tell again. The snake rattled his tail and laughed. I told you that secrets are hard to keep, my friend. We'll see how long you last this time. "

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Digging for dinosaurs was hot work. Benny sat back on his heels and took a long drink from his water bottle. At first, when Mom and Dad had told him they were going on a dinosaur dig for vacation, he'd been excited. He'd bragged to his friends that he'd find the skeleton of a never-before-discovered dinosaur. The Benosaurus, they'd probably name it. But the real dig wasn't at all what he'd expected. For starters, he wasn't even digging. No shovels, Dave, the paleontologist in charge, told them. Any dinosaur bones buried here should be within a couple of feet of the surface. We don't want to risk clunking around and breaking them. Then he'd handed out ice picks and paint brushes and showed everyone how to chip and brush away sand and dirt, slowly and carefully, a little bit at a time. The most important thing is knowing where to look, Dave said. Some rocks aren't old enough to have dinosaur bones. Other rocks are too old. We've studied this area before and found lots of fossils, so I'm hopeful you'll find some too! Well, that had been two days ago, and so far the most exciting thing Benny had found was that his front tooth was loose. He wiggled it now. If he couldn't find any dinosaur bones, at least he could show his friends back home that he'd lost another tooth. Dave crouched beside Benny. How's it going? he asked. OK, Benny said. It didn't seem very nice to say that he was bored. This is pretty slow. Dave nodded. Yep, he agreed. It's hard work. Sometimes paleontologists and fossil hunters look for weeks without finding anything. And we hardly ever find a whole skeleton. He added, You know, Ben, if you're tired of searching, you can always help someone else on the crew. Benny looked around the dry, rocky hillside. Dave's assistants were busy taking photographs and drawing pictures and making charts. Some were using GPS devices to make maps of the area. Some were writing in notebooks. Dave said it was important to take good field notes, to record exactly what you did and where you were when you looked for fossils. Benny thought holding the GPS tool might be fun, but he wasn't giving up. I'll keep looking, he said. But, he added, thinking out loud, the pictures always show dinosaurs in swampy places. Did they live in deserts, too? Ahh, said Dave. Some probably did, but not around here. Millions of years ago, this wasn't desert. It was wet and green and lush. The Earth's changed a lot since the time of the dinosaurs. Dave slapped Benny on the back and got to his feet. Keep up the good work, Ben, he said encouragingly. I think today will be your lucky day! Pick, chip, brush, and sweep. Benny bent over his patch of rocky ground and carefully cleared away the sand and gravel. When he needed a break, he wiggled his loose tooth. The sun climbed higher and hotter into the sky. He was getting into the rhythm of things. Either that, or the heat was just making him drowsy. And then it happened. My tooth! Benny said, surprised. He stared down at the dirt. MY TOOTH! Benny whooped. My dinosaur tooth! I found a real, live dinosaur tooth! Dave hurried over to look, careful not to disturb the ground in front of Benny's find. Well, I'll be! he said. It's a tooth all right! What kind is it? Benny asked excitedly. Is it T. rex? Apatosaurus? Triceratops? Dave laughed, but he kept studying the fossil in the ground. Well, Ben, he finally said, I've seen a lot of dinosaur teeth, but this one's different. I think you may have found one we haven't seen before. Good job! "

                         Much like human children, young dolphins love to play with toys. Wild dolphins are very curious. They explore their world, looking for interesting items. A piece of seaweed might inspire a game. The frisky calves will chase one another, passing the seaweed from snout, to flipper, to tail. When most young animals wrestle, race, or chase, it's not about winning. Each youngster is building its strength and skills. And they are learning to cooperate. If one youngster plays too rough, the others will let him know they are unhappy with his behavior. Even when everyone cooperates, play can get dangerous. But animals play anyway! Young mountain goats live all their lives on steep slopes. The kids bump each other and butt heads in fun. If they're not careful, kids can fall and hurt their legs or even break their bones. When they play, the young animals learn to keep their footing no matter what might happen. Groups of young vervet monkeys sometimes sneak away from the adults in their family. All wrapped up in their games, the little ones may not notice when danger is near. So an adult monkey will go looking for the straying youngsters. The adult will yell out a warning. Watch out! Be careful! You've heard parents or teachers say these things when you play. Animals have to learn about the dangers in their world too. Playing helps them learn. Playing helps them get along. Playing makes them strong and confident."

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             When Ma Ma left Shanghai for America, I didn't know it would be so long before I saw her again that I forgot her smell. Not quite, but when I did finally see her, more than one year had passed and her smell had changed. There was no more of her soft perfume along with the anise that she put in the soup. Ma Ma had a sharp soap smell instead. It was so strange to me that I almost didn't recognize her. The flight attendant brought me to her. I'd been asleep on the plane so my careful pigtails were all messed up. At first I wasn't even sure that it really was Ma Ma, and I held tightly to the hand of the lady. Grandma Po Po had asked her to deliver me safely to my mother. I wasn't scared. When Po Po told me to be brave on the long trip, I wondered why she said that. Sitting on a plane with a nice lady to watch over me wasn't scary. But now when I smelled the sharp soap, I knew what she meant. Ting, you have grown so tall, Ma Ma said, scooping me into her arms. The lady left and tears came out of my eyes. Don't cry, Ting, Ma Ma said, wiping my face with her palm. We'll go home and have some soup. Noodle soup to celebrate that you are in America. I listened to Ma Ma's words. Her voice was the same as I remembered it. Where is Ba Ba? I asked. He had to go to Chicago. He'll come back to see you very soon. I tried to imagine how my father looked, but all I could remember was the smoky smell of his clothes. I held tightly to Ma Ma's hand as we went through the airport. The voices around us were so flat. No up and down sounds. When I was in Shanghai, Uncle said I should learn English. He found an English teacher who came to our apartment every Wednesday and Friday after school. She had ten English books and I finished all of them. But at the airport, I didn't hear the words in my books. I gripped Ma Ma's hand, so much smoother than Po Po's. The noodle soup was almost the same but not quite. In my mouth it was fine, but the smell was not right. I had only a few spoonfuls. You don't like soup anymore? Now you like meat? I shook my head. The room was spinning. The kitchen stove was gigantic. It even had a door like a room. What's that? I asked. Oven, Ma Ma said in English. She explained in Chinese. It gets very hot inside. In Shanghai, we didn't have an oven. Po Po cooked everything on an electric hot plate on the landing. Soup, noodles, everything. Ma Ma showed me my bed. It had a blue plaid blanket on it. The room was like a closet with a small window at the end. Can I sleep with you? I asked. In China I slept with my cousin Hong. She took all the covers and pushed me into a small space against the wall, but still I was not alone. In America you have your own room, Ma Ma said. The bed was so fresh and new. My nightgown had the same soapy smell as the noodles. The air was too quiet. "

It's winter in Alaska-midnight-nine degrees above zero. And yet, there are people-grown-ups bundled against the cold; children are clothed in scarves, gloves, and fur-lined boots, outside, looking at the sky. Why? It is because the sky is putting on a show for them, a show we call the northern lights. Scientists call it the aurora borealis. Sometimes the northern lights are soft clouds of white. Sometimes they dance across the sky in streaks of blue and green, yellow and red. What causes the northern lights? Why can they be seen only at night? And why do they change from night to night? Scientists give us some answers. The Earth is a huge magnet, with two poles, the North Pole and the South Pole. The sun has storms that send out streams of tiny particles called electrons. Scientists call this stream the solar wind. It races off into space and is pulled toward our two poles by their magnetic force. Reaching the Earth's atmosphere, the wind hits a stone wall, the magnetic field that surrounds the Earth, called the magnetosphere. Energy from the solar wind creates an electric charge. That is what makes the aurora borealis, or northern lights, near the North Pole; the aurora australis, or southern lights, are near the South Pole. What makes the different colors? There is an easy answer for scientists. We've seen different-colored, neon signs. Imagine such huge lights hanging high in space-100 miles high. When electricity heats up gases, they turn colors. The electric charge in the magnetosphere goes through nitrogen in the air, and it glows with a blue light. Oxygen turns green or sometimes red. The stronger the solar wind, the stronger the electric charge and the more colorful the aurora are. Because the southern aurora can be seen only in or near Antarctica, most people see the northern lights. To see them best, people look for them in 2015 ELA Grade 3 Released Questions 2324 2015 ELA Grade 3 Released Questions 7 8 9 September or March. At that time, there are 12 hours of darkness, and the solar winds are usually stronger. But why is this only at night? The auroras shine all day and all night, just as stars do. During daylight, the sun outshines them. The best time to see the northern lights is between midnight and 2:00 a.m. Is it worth staying up that late? You bet, especially when the solar wind is so strong that the lights are as colorful as they can be. The northern lights take on different shapes: shimmering curtains, colored clouds twisting and turning, and arcs of colors covering the entire sky. They appear close to the North Pole. If you do not live in places like Alaska, Norway, or Canada, you probably won't see them. But you can see pictures of them on an aurora website. Our world is filled with beautiful sights. A midnight sky filled with color in a cold, cold climate is one of the most beautiful."

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Mom, why do we always have to wait in line? asked Eli. He slumped against the grocery cart. We're waiting our turn, said Mom. Eli sighed and rolled his head back to stare at the ceiling. An escaped pirate balloon bobbed up and down against the flat white lights. One of the pirate's eyes was covered with a coal-black patch, and the other winked down at Eli. If I were a pirate, I wouldn't have to wait in line, thought Eli. He flashed his jeweled saber and shouted to the trusty crew, Aarrr, maties! Clear the bloomin' decks! A band of swashbuckling pirates dashed through the line of shoppers. They danced a feisty jig and tossed gold doubloons in the air. While shoppers chased the rolling coins, Eli and Mom rushed to the front of the checkout line. They escaped in a magnificent pirate ship and sailed the seven seas home. There, Eli searched for hidden treasure with his friend, Max, for the rest of the afternoon. Pirates never had to wait in line at the grocery store. Let's go, Eli, said Mom as they left the checkout line. We need to stop at the bank. Will there be a line there, too? asked Eli. Maybe, said Mom. Aargh, grumbled Eli. The line at the bank looked even longer than the grocery store line. Whoosh! What was that sound? Eli peered over the bank counter to the drive-through. Customers were placing plastic tubes in some sort of portal, pressing a button, and swoosh-the tubes zoomed through the air to the bank teller inside. It looked like a starship launcher! Starship commanders don't have to wait in line at the bank, thought Eli. He switched on his light laser and flipped open his star command communication device. Command Control, come in! We've got a long line here at Galactic Bank. Please send backup! he ordered. A fleet of starships swooped down to the bank parking lot. The people in line rushed out the door to gape at the sleek, blinking starships. Can we have a ride? they begged. While the starship commanders took turns giving rides, Mom and Eli swept to the front of the line. Eli whisked out his tele- transporter gadget and beamed them home to watch back-to-back episodes of Star Guys Planet. Starship commanders never had to wait in line at the bank. Eli, said Mom as they left the bank, want to pick up dinner at Burger Barn on the way home? Will we get to wait in line? asked Eli. Possibly, said Mom. Eli smiled. They left the bank and zoomed over to Burger Barn, where the line was longer than a clippety-cloppin' mule train. But Eli didn't mind. Cowboy sheriffs never have to wait in line at Burger Barn! Please step aside, mister. Step aside, ma'am. Sheriff Eli tipped his ten-gallon hat, gave his silver spurs a whirl, and swaggered to the front of the line. No one minded. Sheriff Eli was the hero of Goldtown. Have you caught any cattle rustlers today, Sheriff? the pigtailed waitress asked. Only \xfc\xbe\x8c\x93\xa4\xbcbout twenty or thirty. Got \xfc\xbe\x8c\x93\xa4\xbcem all locked up so Goldtown is safe once more. Everyone in Burger Barn whooped and hollered. All in a day's work, said Sheriff Eli. Now my throat's full of trail dust, and my belly's growlin' somethin' fierce. While he waited for his food he let the young \xfc\xbe\x8c\x93\xa4\xbcuns twirl his sparkling silver spurs and tie knots in his lasso. Thank ye kindly, he said to the Burger Barn waitress. She piled on extra fries. Sheriff Eli tipped his hat and rode off into the sunset eating his Golden Chicken Nuggets, French fries, and milk. O.K., Eli, let's go, said Mom. Wh-what? said Eli. We're finished with our errands for today, said Mom. How about meeting Max at the park? Max, me matey? said Eli. Bloomin' great idea! You might have to wait in line for the slide. Star command check! And maybe the swings, too. Always glad to step aside until my turn, ma'am, Eli drawled. Mom laughed as Eli hoisted himself into the car and swashbuckled his seatbelt. She fired up their sleek galactic starship and they followed the winding, dusty trail to the park. "

means ball tag and jumping jacks, right? SNOW WAY! Teachers say snowshoes are improving their students': hearts and lungs, muscles, and spirits. Kids just say it's fun! It's sort of like you're walking on thin air, said Troy Pierce, eight. The snowshoes sort of keep you up on the snow. And that's pretty important where they live, said Alex Almquist. Alex and Troy are students at Hancock Elementary School in the far northern part of Michigan. There's lots and lots of snow, laughed Alex. That means snowshoes are perfect for gym class in the winter. The benefit of snowshoeing for kids is getting their heart rate up near maximum, says Julie Hamar, a PE teacher at Hancock Elementary School in Hancock, Michigan. It's a good all around activity for kids. In other words, It's hard to walk and it gets your legs all strong, said Troy. Nearly 400 students in Ms. Hamar's PE classes get to use the snowshoes, taking hikes, running relay races, and doing outside exercises. The school's PTO purchased the snowshoes for the kids recently. Not only do PE classes use them, but regular classes strap them on for outside nature hikes and wildlife study, too. I teach them the basic technique: how to put on the snowshoes and the proper ways of walking in snowshoes, Ms. Hamar says. You have to lift your feet up or you're going to trip, cautions Alex, eight. Snowshoes are huge. The classes take a short hike around the school. Then they hit the slopes and trails nearby. It's not unusual to see animal signs. We saw tracks and a den, said Troy. The rabbit that made them had something in common with the kids. Their feet are really flat, like snowshoes, Troy said. They're better for walking. It's good for the kids because it's extra hard work walking on the snowshoes in deep snow, says Ms. Hamar. You can tell. They start to unzip their jackets; they're starting to sweat underneath their hats. All that means the kids are getting good exercise and having fun instead of sitting around all winter. Making tracks outside means getting strong inside. Snow Toes Sam Watson has been on the snowshoe crew longer than he can remember. His father started making children's snowshoes when Sam was only two or three. But he recalls lots of snowshoeing from about age 5 or 6, as his father, Jim Watson, the founder of Little Bear Snowshoes, created new shoes. Of course, I was the logical one to test them, says Sam, now 11. But snowshoes are also a great way to reach the hidden skiing and ice shing spots that Sam loves. You're strapped onto a big oval-shaped sort of platform and that allows more surface on the snow, so you don't sink, he says. Snowshoes spread your weight out over the snow, says Sam, showing the wide working surface of snowshoes above. You can go out in the wintertime and not worry about getting snow in your pants and freezing your legs off.  "

                                 All the way there David had saved this moment for himself, struggling not to peek until the proper time came. When the car finally stopped, the rest of them got out stiffly and went into the new house. But David walked slowly into the back yard with his eyes fixed on the ground. For a whole minute he stood there, not daring to look up. Then he took a deep breath, clenched his hands tightly, and lifted his head. There it was!-as Dad had described it, but infinitely more grand. It swept upward from the valley floor, beautifully shaped and soaring, so tall that its misty blue peak could surely talk face to face with the stars. To David, who had never seen a mountain before, the sight was almost too much to bear. He felt so tight and shivery inside that he didn't know whether he wanted to laugh, or cry, or both. And the really wonderful thing about the mountain was the way it looked at him. He was certain that it was smiling at him, like an old friend who had been waiting for years to see him again. And when he closed his eyes, he seemed to hear a voice which whispered, Come along, then, and climb. It would be so easy to go! The back yard was hedged in (with part of the hedge growing right across the toes of the mountain), but there was a hole in the privet large enough to crawl through. And just beyond the hedge the mountainside awaited him, going up and up in one smooth sweep until the green and tawny faded into hazy heights of rock. It was waiting for him. Come and climb, it whispered, come and climb. But there was a great deal to do first. They were going to move into the new house. The moving van was standing out in front, the car must be unloaded. David would be needed to carry things. Regretfully, he waved his hand at the peak and whispered, It shouldn't take long-I'll be back as soon as I can. Then he went around to the front door to see what could be done about speeding things up. Inside, everything was in confusion. Dad was pushing chairs and tables around in an aimless way. Mother was saying, They'll all have to go out again; we forgot to put down the rug first. Aunt Amy was making short dashes between the kitchen and the dining room, muttering to herself. And Beckie was roaring in her crib because it was time for her bottle. David asked, Can I do anything?-hoping that the answer would be no. C'mere, Aunt Amy said, grabbing him by the arm. Help me look for that ironing board. When the ironing board was finally located, Mother had something for him to do. And when he was finished with that, Dad called for his help. So the afternoon wore on without letup-and also without any signs of progress in their moving. When David finally got a chance to sneak out for a breathing spell, he felt his heart sink. Somehow, in all the rush and confusion, the afternoon had disappeared. Already the evening sun was throwing shadows across the side of the mountain and touching its peak with a ruddy blaze. It was too late now. He would have to wait until morning before he could climb. "

And that brings up one of the main differences between sea turtles and most other kinds of turtles. Most turtles have shells like houses that they can pull their heads and limbs into. But a sea turtle can't pull into its shell at all. The shells of most kinds of sea turtles are made of bone and cartilage (the same bendable stuff your ears are made of). These are covered with thin plates called scutes. But the leatherback's shell is different. Its shell is made up of cartilage and tiny bones, but covering these is a layer of leathery skin. SUITED FOR THE SEA Sea turtles breathe air with lungs, just as you can do. But they can hold their breath a lot longer than you ever could. The green sea turtle is the champ. It can stay underwater for as long as five hours! To swim, sea turtles use their strong, paddle-shaped front flippers. Their hind flippers help with steering. But sea turtles are more than just great swimmers. Some of them are great divers. The leatherback can dive more than a thousand feet deep, looking for food. That's the length of three football fields. And its deepest dives can be three times deeper than that! CHOW TIME Did someone mention food? Depending on the species, sea turtles can be animal-eaters, plant-eaters, or both. They don't even have teeth, but their beaks can give clues as to what they eat. The sharp, strong beak of the loggerhead turtle, for example, is great for crushing the shells of crabs and shrimp. A hawksbill's narrow, pointed beak helps it pull prey such as sponges from tight spaces in a coral reef. A leatherback has a soft, delicate beak-just the thing for eating squishy foods such as jellyfish. And the green sea turtle's jagged-edged beak is great for snipping sea grasses and scraping algae off coral and rocks. NESTING TIME Sea turtles spend almost their entire lives in the water. But when it's nesting time, the females come ashore to lay their eggs. They often return to the same beaches where they themselves hatched. In most species, a female sea turtle comes ashore at night. She crawls clumsily along the sand. Next, she uses her flippers to dig a nest. Depending on the species, she lays from 50 to 200 round, white eggs. Then she covers them up with sand and lumbers back into the sea. Later, the baby turtles hatch from the eggs and dig their way out of the nest. They crawl down to the shoreline and then disappear into the waves. TURTLE TROUBLES Sea turtles have been around for millions of years. But these days they face their share of troubles. Many get caught in fishing nets or tangled in fishing lines. Turtles are also harmed by pollution, litter, and oil spills. Lights along the streets and on buildings near the beach can cause problems, too. Newly hatched babies can become lost and crawl toward the artificial light instead of the ocean where they belong. HOPE FOR THE FUTURE The good news is that lots of people are trying hard to help sea turtles. Many laws have been passed to protect them. In some places, for example, beach communities are required to turn off outside lights at night during nesting season. And to keep eggs safe from predators, pollution, and other dangers, people sometimes carefully dig them up and move them to nurseries protected by high fences. Thanks to conservation efforts like these, sea turtle numbers are actually going up in some places. With a little luck, these ancient reptiles will be flapping through the sea for another hundred million years! "

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               She went to various clothes heaps in my room and revealed the slices of bread, which ranged from slightly moldy to totally overgrown. Benji picked up the pieces and laid them out on my desk. If the bread hadn't been buried in my wardrobe like some sort of ancient Egyptian funeral offering, I probably would have found it pretty fascinating. I'm sorry, Ellen said again. I'll explain to your mom that this was my fault. And I'll help you clean your room. Okay? If there's one thing I'm really good at, it's straightening up. She looked at me like she expected me to turn her down. She seemed really sorry. Sure. You can help. That would be wonderful. I'll help too, Benji said. George nodded. Thanks, I said as we tackled the top layer. This is great. But we still don't have a project. Sure we do. I was so shocked by the voice, I just stared at George. We do? Benji asked. George nodded and pointed at the bread. Mold! Ellen said. We have a whole display of the stages of mold growth. Yeah, I said. George was right. We had pieces of bread for each week. But is that enough? It was hard to imagine a whole project from some slices of moldy bread. Then I realized it wasn't just about mold growth. Look, I said, flipping a piece over. Ellen nodded. Mayonnaise. It's acidic. Yup. We have an example of mold inhibition too. We just have to figure out a way to display it so you can see both sides. Great, Ellen said. But what if it's still not enough? Oh, there might be some more . . . Benji said. What do you mean? I asked. Promise you won't kill me? No. Promise you won't make it slow and painful? No. He shrugged. I sorta don't like turkey a whole lot. Oh, please don't tell me you've been stashing meat in my room. He nodded. Where? I sniffed and looked around. Benji pointed at the top of my bookcase. You slimeball, I said as I climbed a chair to take a look. Oh, yuck. There were five piles of turkey in various stages of decomposition, neatly laid out from left to right. It was absolutely disgusting. It was also pretty fascinating. And I guess I was relieved to know the smell wasn't coming from my clothes. I looked over at George. What about you? Is there anything you don't like? He lifted a stack of books to reveal baby carrots. We got back to work. At five, I asked Ellen, Don't you have a piano lesson? It won't hurt me to miss one. She flipped open her cell phone and made a call. Right after that, George left. I figured he had some sort of appointment he couldn't cancel. But I was grateful he'd helped for as long as he could. There was still plenty to do. The rest of us kept working. Just as we were finishing, George returned, holding a beautiful display case with sections for the bread, turkey, and carrots. It even had mirrors in it to show both sides of the specimens. Wow, I said, that's perfect. Did you build it? He nodded. You're a genius with your hands, I said. He smiled. I'll do the captions, Benji said. He started coming up with these awful puns that made everyone groan, like, Spore score and seven weeks ago, Rot and roll, and Bacterial Girl. But we laughed too. And I knew Ms. Adler had a great sense of humor, so I figured it wouldn't hurt to use Benji's titles. Ellen, who had beautiful handwriting, lettered the signs. I typed a report to go along with the display. As we all finished up the project together, I realized I'd discovered an important scientific principle. It had nothing to do with mold, but everything to do with chemistry. Some elements combined quickly. Others combined slowly. And some didn't combine at all unless you mixed them together under high heat and intense pressure. "
